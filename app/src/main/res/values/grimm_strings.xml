    <string name="story7text">Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little riding hood of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else; so she was always called \'Little Red Riding Hood.\'\n\nOne day her mother said to her: \'Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing; and when you go into her room, don\'t forget to say, \"Good morning\", and don\'t peep into every corner before you do it.\'\n\n\'I will take great care,\' said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, and gave her hand on it.\n\nThe grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.\n\n\'Good day, Little Red Riding Hood,\' said he.\n\n\'Thank you kindly, wolf.\'\n\n\'Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?\'\n\n\'To my grandmother\'s.\'\n\n\'What have you got in your apron?\'\n\n\'Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.\'\n\n\'Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?\'\n\n\'A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you surely must know it,\' replied Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nThe wolf thought to himself: \'What a tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful - she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both.\'\n\nSo he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Hood, and then he said: \'See, Little Red Riding Hood, how pretty the flowers are about here - why do you not look round? I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.\'\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought: \'Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time.\'\n\nSo she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.\n\nMeanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother\'s house and knocked at the door.\n\n\'Who is there?\'\n\n\'Little Red Riding Hood,\' replied the wolf. \'She is bringing cake and wine; open the door.\'\n\n\'Lift the latch,\' called out the grandmother, \'I am too weak, and cannot get up.\'\n\nThe wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother\'s bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.\n\nShe was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself: \'Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.\' She called out: \'Good morning,\' but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.\n\n\'Oh! grandmother,\' she said, \'what big ears you have!\'\n\n\'All the better to hear you with, my child,\' was the reply.\n\n\'But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!\' she said.\n\n\'All the better to see you with, my dear.\'\n\n\'But, grandmother, what large hands you have!\'\n\n\'All the better to hug you with.\'\n\n\'Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!\'\n\n\'All the better to eat you with!\'\n\nAnd scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red Riding Hood.\n\nWhen the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud.\n\nThe huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself: \'How the old woman is snoring! I must just see if she wants anything.\' So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it.\n\n\'Do I find you here, you old sinner!\' said he. \'I have long sought you!\' But just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf.\n\nWhen he had made two snips, he saw the little red riding hood shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying: \'Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was inside the wolf.\'\n\nAfter that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red Riding Hood, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf\'s belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.\n\nThen all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf\'s skin and went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Red Riding Hood had brought, and revived. But Red Riding Hood thought to herself: \'As long as I live, I will never leave the path by myself to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.\'\n\nIt is also related that once, when Red Riding Hood was again taking cakes to the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path. Red Riding Hood, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said \'good morning\' to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up.\n\n\'Well,\' said the grandmother, \'we will shut the door, so that he can not come in.\'\n\nSoon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried: \'Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red Riding Hood, and am bringing you some cakes.\'\n\nBut they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until Red Riding Hood went home in the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts.\n\nIn front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the child: \'Take the pail, Red Riding Hood; I made some sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.\'\n\nRed Riding Hood carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned. But Red Riding Hood went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again.</string>
    <string name="story8text">There were once a man and a woman who had long, in vain, wished for a child. At length it appeared that God was about to grant their desire.\n\nThese people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world.\n\nOne day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion, and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it. She quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable.\n\nHer husband was alarmed, and asked: \'What ails you, dear wife?\'\n\n\'Ah,\' she replied, \'if I can\'t eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.\'\n\nThe man, who loved her, thought: \'Sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.\'\n\nAt twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It tasted so good to her - so very good, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before.\n\nIf he was to have any rest, her husband knew he must once more descend into the garden. Therefore, in the gloom of evening, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him.\n\n\'How can you dare,\' said she with angry look, \'descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!\'\n\n\'Ah,\' answered he, \'let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat.\'\n\nThe enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him: \'If the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.\'\n\nThe man in his terror consented to everything.\n\nWhen the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.\n\nRapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower in the middle of a forest. The tower had neither stairs nor door, but near the top was a little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried:\n\n\'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nLet down your hair to me.\'\nRapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress, she unfastened her braided tresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.\n\nAfter a year or two, it came to pass that the king\'s son rode through the forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened. It was Rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king\'s son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it.\n\nOnce when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:\n\n\'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nLet down your hair to me.\'\nThen Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her.\n\n\'If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too will try my fortune,\' said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried:\n\n\'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nLet down your hair to me.\'\nImmediately the hair fell down and the king\'s son climbed up.\n\nAt first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her; but the king\'s son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought: \'He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does\'; and she said yes, and laid her hand in his.\n\nShe said: \'I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.\'\n\nThey agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said to her: \'Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king\'s son - he is with me in a moment.\'\n\n\'Ah! you wicked child,\' cried the enchantress. \'What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have deceived me!\'\n\nIn her anger she clutched Rapunzel\'s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery.\n\nOn the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the window, and when the king\'s son came and cried:\n\n\'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nLet down your hair to me.\'\nShe let the hair down. The king\'s son ascended, but instead of finding his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks.\n\n\'Aha!\' she cried mockingly, \'you would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost to you; you will never see her again.\'\n\nThe king\'s son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes.\n\nHe wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented.</string>
    <string name="story9text">Once there was a miller who was poor, but who had a beautiful daughter. Now it happened that he had to go and speak to the king, and in order to make himself appear important he said to him, \"I have a daughter who can spin straw into gold.\"\n\nThe king said to the miller, \"That is an art which pleases me well, if your daughter is as clever as you say, bring her to-morrow to my palace, and I will put her to the test.\"\n\nAnd when the girl was brought to him he took her into a room which was quite full of straw, gave her a spinning-wheel and a reel, and said, \"Now set to work, and if by to-morrow morning early you have not spun this straw into gold during the night, you must die.\"\n\nThereupon he himself locked up the room, and left her in it alone. So there sat the poor miller\'s daughter, and for the life of her could not tell what to do, she had no idea how straw could be spun into gold, and she grew more and more frightened, until at last she began to weep.\n\nBut all at once the door opened, and in came a little man, and said, \"Good evening, mistress miller, why are you crying so?\"\n\n\"Alas,\" answered the girl, \"I have to spin straw into gold, and I do not know how to do it.\"\n\n\"What will you give me,\" said the manikin, \"if I do it for you?\"\n\n\"My necklace,\" said the girl.\n\nThe little man took the necklace, seated himself in front of the wheel, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three turns, and the reel was full, then he put another on, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three times round, and the second was full too. And so it went on until the morning, when all the straw was spun, and all the reels were full of gold.\n\nBy daybreak the king was already there, and when he saw the gold he was astonished and delighted, but his heart became only more greedy. He had the miller\'s daughter taken into another room full of straw, which was much larger, and commanded her to spin that also in one night if she valued her life. The girl knew not how to help herself, and was crying, when the door opened again, and the little man appeared, and said, \"What will you give me if I spin that straw into gold for you?\"\n\n\"The ring on my finger,\" answered the girl.\n\nThe little man took the ring, again began to turn the wheel, and by morning had spun all the straw into glittering gold.\n\nThe king rejoiced beyond measure at the sight, but still he had not gold enough, and he had the miller\'s daughter taken into a still larger room full of straw, and said, \"You must spin this, too, in the course of this night, but if you succeed, you shall be my wife.\"\n\nEven if she be a miller\'s daughter, thought he, I could not find a richer wife in the whole world.\n\nWhen the girl was alone the manikin came again for the third time, and said, \"What will you give me if I spin the straw for you this time also?\"\n\n\"I have nothing left that I could give,\" answered the girl.\n\n\"Then promise me, if you should become queen, to give me your first child.\"\n\nWho knows whether that will ever happen, thought the miller\'s daughter, and, not knowing how else to help herself in this strait, she promised the manikin what he wanted, and for that he once more spun the straw into gold.\n\nAnd when the king came in the morning, and found all as he had wished, he took her in marriage, and the pretty miller\'s daughter became a queen.\n\nA year after, she brought a beautiful child into the world, and she never gave a thought to the manikin. But suddenly he came into her room, and said, \"Now give me what you promised.\"\n\nThe queen was horror-struck, and offered the manikin all the riches of the kingdom if he would leave her the child. But the manikin said, \"No, something alive is dearer to me than all the treasures in the world.\"\n\nThen the queen began to lament and cry, so that the manikin pitied her.\n\n\"I will give you three days, time,\" said he, \"if by that time you find out my name, then shall you keep your child.\"\n\nSo the queen thought the whole night of all the names that she had ever heard, and she sent a messenger over the country to inquire, far and wide, for any other names that there might be. When the manikin came the next day, she began with Caspar, Melchior, Balthazar, and said all the names she knew, one after another, but to every one the little man said, \"That is not my name.\"\n\nOn the second day she had inquiries made in the neighborhood as to the names of the people there, and she repeated to the manikin the most uncommon and curious. Perhaps your name is Shortribs, or Sheepshanks, or Laceleg, but he always answered, \"That is not my name.\"\n\nOn the third day the messenger came back again, and said, \"I have not been able to find a single new name, but as I came to a high mountain at the end of the forest, where the fox and the hare bid each other good night, there I saw a little house, and before the house a fire was burning, and round about the fire quite a ridiculous little man was jumping, he hopped upon one leg, and shouted –\n\n\'To-day I bake, to-morrow brew,\nthe next I\'ll have the young queen\'s child.\nHa, glad am I that no one knew\nthat Rumpelstiltskin I am styled.\'\"\nYou may imagine how glad the queen was when she heard the name. And when soon afterwards the little man came in, and asked, \"Now, mistress queen, what is my name?\"\n\nAt first she said, \"Is your name Conrad?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Is your name Harry?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Perhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin?\"\n\n\"The devil has told you that! The devil has told you that,\" cried the little man, and in his anger he plunged his right foot so deep into the earth that his whole leg went in, and then in rage he pulled at his left leg so hard with both hands that he tore himself in two.</string>
    <string name="story10text">In the old times, when it was still of some use to wish for the thing one wanted, there lived a King whose daughters were all handsome, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun himself, who has seen so much, wondered each time he shone over her because of her beauty. Near the royal castle there was a great dark wood, and in the wood under an old linden-tree was a well; and when the day was hot, the King\'s daughter used to go forth into the wood and sit by the brink of the cool well, and if the time seemed long, she would take out a golden ball, and throw it up and catch it again, and this was her favourite pastime.\n\nNow it happened one day that the golden ball, instead of falling back into the maiden\'s little hand which had sent it aloft, dropped to the ground near the edge of the well and rolled in. The king\'s daughter followed it with her eyes as it sank, but the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. Then she began to weep, and she wept and wept as if she could never be comforted. And in the midst of her weeping she heard a voice saying to her: \"What ails thee, king\'s daughter? Thy tears would melt a heart of stone.\" And when she looked to see where the voice came from, there was nothing but a frog stretching his thick ugly head out of the water. \"Oh, is it you, old waddler?\" said she, \"I weep because my golden ball has fallen into the well.\" - \"Never mind, do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help you; but what will you give me if I fetch up your ball again?\" - \"Whatever you like, dear frog,\" said she, \"any of my clothes, my pearls and jewels, or even the golden crown that I wear.\" - \"Thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, and thy golden crown are not for me,\" answered the frog, \"but if thou wouldst love me, and have me for thy companion and play-fellow, and let me sit by thee at table, and eat from thy plate, and drink from thy cup, and sleep in thy little bed, if thou wouldst promise all this, then would I dive below the water and fetch thee thy golden ball again.\" - \"Oh yes,\" she answered, \"I will promise it all, whatever you want, if you will only get me my ball again.\" But she thought to herself: What nonsense he talks! As if he could do anything but sit in the water and croak with the other frogs, or could possibly be any one\'s companion.\n\nBut the frog, as soon as he heard her promise, drew his head under the water and sank down out of sight, but after a while he came to the surface again with the ball in his mouth, and he threw it on the grass. The King\'s daughter was overjoyed to see her pretty plaything again, and she caught it up and ran off with it. \"Stop, stop!\" cried the frog, \"take me up too. I cannot run as fast as you!\" But it was of no use, for croak, croak after her as he might, she would not listen to him, but made haste home, and very soon forgot all about the poor frog, who had to betake himself to his well again.\n\nThe next day, when the King\'s daughter was sitting at table with the King and all the court, and eating from her golden plate, there came something pitter patter up the marble stairs, and then there came a knocking at the door, and a voice crying: \"Youngest King\'s daughter, let me in!\" And she got up and ran to see who it could be, but when she opened the door, there was the frog sitting outside. Then she shut the door hastily and went back to her seat, feeling very uneasy. The King noticed how quickly her heart was beating, and said: \"My child, what are you afraid of? Is there a giant standing at the door ready to carry you away?\" - \"Oh no,\" answered she, \"no giant, but a horrid frog.\" - \"And what does the frog want?\" asked the King. \"O dear father,\" answered she, \"when I was sitting by the well yesterday, and playing with my golden ball, it fell into the water, and while I was crying for the loss of it, the frog came and got it again for me on condition I would let him be my companion, but I never thought that he could leave the water and come after me; but now there he is outside the door, and he wants to come in to me.\" And then they all heard him knocking the second time and crying:\n\n\"Youngest King\'s daughter,\nOpen to me!\nBy the well water\nWhat promised\nyou me?\nYoungest King\'s daughter\nNow open to me!\"\n\n\"That which thou hast promised must thou perform,\" said the King, \"so go now and let him in.\" So she went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in, following at her heels, till she reached her chair. Then he stopped and cried: \"Lift me up to sit by you.\" But she delayed doing so until the King ordered her. When once the frog was on the chair, he wanted to get on the table, and there he sat and said: \"Now push your golden plate a little nearer, so that we may eat together.\" And so she did, but everybody might see how unwilling she was, and the frog feasted heartily, but every morsel seemed to stick in her throat. \"I have had enough now,\" said the frog at last, \"and as I am tired, you must carry me to your room, and make ready your silken bed, and we will lie down and go to sleep.\" Then the King\'s daughter began to weep, and was afraid of the cold frog, that nothing would satisfy him but he must sleep in her pretty clean bed. Now the King grew angry with her, saying: \"That which thou hast promised in thy time of necessity, must thou now perform.\" So she picked up the frog with her finger and thumb, carried him upstairs and put him in a corner, and when she had lain down to sleep, he came creeping up, saying: \"I am tired and want sleep as much as you; take me up, or I will tell your father.\" Then she felt beside herself with rage, and picking him up, she threw him with all her strength against the wall, crying: \"Now will you be quiet, you horrid frog!\"\n\nBut as he fell, he ceased to be a frog, and became all at once a prince with beautiful kind eyes. And it came to pass that, with her father\'s consent, they became bride and bridegroom. And he told her how a wicked witch had bound him by her spells, and how no one but she alone could have released him, and that they two would go together to his father\'s kingdom. And there came to the door a carriage drawn by eight white horses, with white plumes on their heads, and with golden harness, and behind the carriage was standing faithful Henry, the servant of the young prince. Now, faithful Henry had suffered such care and pain when his master was turned into a frog, that he had been obliged to wear three iron bands over his heart, to keep it from breaking with trouble and anxiety. When the carriage started to take the prince to his kingdom, and faithful Henry had helped them both in, he got up behind, and was full of joy at his master\'s deliverance.\n\nAnd when they had gone a part of the way, the prince heard a sound at the back of the carriage, as if something had broken, and he turned round and cried:\n\n\"Henry, the wheel must be breaking!\"\n\"The wheel does not break,\n\'Tis the band round my heart\nThat, to lessen its ache,\nWhen I grieved for your sake,\nI bound round my heart.\"\n\nAgain, and yet once again there was the same sound, and the prince thought it must be the wheel breaking, but it was the breaking of the other bands from faithful Henry\'s heart, because it was now so relieved and happy.</string>
    <string name="story280text">There was once upon a time a King, but where he reigned and what he was called, I do not know. He had no son, but an only daughter who had always been ill, and no doctor had been able to cure her. Then it was foretold to the King that his daughter should eat herself well with an apple. So he ordered it to be proclaimed throughout the whole of his kingdom, that whosoever brought his daughter an apple with which she could eat herself well, should have her to wife, and be King. This became known to a peasant who had three sons, and he said to the eldest, \"Go out into the garden and take a basketful of those beautiful apples with the red cheeks and carry them to the court; perhaps the King\'s daughter will be able to eat herself well with them, and then thou wilt marry her and be King.\" The lad did so, and set out.\nWhen he had gone a short way he met a little iron man who asked him what he had there in the basket, to which replied Uele, for so was he named, \"Frogs\' legs.\" On this the little man said, \"Well, so shall it be, and remain,\" and went away. At length Uele arrived at the palace, and made it known that he had brought apples which would cure the King\'s daughter if she ate them. This delighted the King hugely, and he caused Uele to be brought before him; but, alas! when he opened the basket, instead of having apples in it he had frogs\' legs which were still kicking about. On this the King grew angry, and had him driven out of the house. When he got home he told his father how it had fared with him. Then the father sent the next son, who was called Seame, but all went with him just as it had gone with Uele. He also met the little iron man, who asked what he had there in the basket. Seame said, \"Hogs\' bristles,\" and the iron man said, \"well, so shall it be, and remain.\" When Seame got to the King\'s palace and said he brought apples with which the King\'s daughter might eat herself well, they did not want to let him go in, and said that one fellow had already been there, and had treated them as if they were fools. Seame, however, maintained that he certainly had the apples, and that they ought to let him go in. At length they believed him, and led him to the King. But when he uncovered the basket, he had but hogs\' bristles. This enraged the King most terribly, so he caused Seame to be whipped out of the house. When he got home he related all that had befallen him, then the youngest boy, whose name was Hans, but who was always called Stupid Hans, came and asked his father if he might go with some apples. \"Oh!\" said the father, \"thou wouldst be just the right fellow for such a thing! If the clever ones can\'t manage it, what canst thou do?\" The boy, however, did not believe him, and said, \"Indeed, father, I wish to go.\" - \"Just get away, thou stupid fellow, thou must wait till thou art wiser,\" said the father to that, and turned his back. Hans, however, pulled at the back of his smock- frock and said, \"Indeed, father, I wish to go.\" - \"Well, then, so far as I am concerned thou mayst go, but thou wilt soon come home again!\" replied the old man in a spiteful voice. The boy, however, was tremendously delighted and jumped for joy. \"Well, act like a fool! thou growest more stupid every day!\" said the father again. Hans, however, did not care about that, and did not let it spoil his pleasure, but as it was then night, he thought he might as well wait until the morrow, for he could not get to court that day. All night long he could not sleep in his bed, and if he did doze for a moment, he dreamt of beautiful maidens, of palaces, of gold, and of silver, and all kinds of things of that sort. Early in the morning, he went forth on his way, and directly afterwards the little shabby-looking man in his iron clothes, came to him and asked what he was carrying in the basket. Hans gave him the answer that he was carrying apples with which the King\'s daughter was to eat herself well. \"Then,\" said the little man, \"so shall they be, and remain.\" But at the court they would none of them let Hans go in, for they said two had already been there who had told them that they were bringing apples, and one of them had frogs\' legs, and the other hogs\' bristles. Hans, however, resolutely maintained that he most certainly had no frogs\' legs, but some of the most beautiful apples in the whole kingdom. As he spoke so pleasantly, the door-keeper thought he could not be telling a lie, and asked him to go in, and he was right, for when Hans uncovered his basket in the King\'s presence, golden-yellow apples came tumbling out. The King was delighted, and caused some of them to be taken to his daughter, and then waited in anxious expectation until news should be brought to him of the effect they had. But before much time had passed by, news was brought to him: but who do you think it was who came? it was his daughter herself! As soon as she had eaten of those apples, she was cured, and sprang out of her bed. The joy the King felt cannot be described! but now he did not want to give his daughter in marriage to Hans, and said he must first make him a boat which would go quicker on dry land than on water. Hans agreed to the conditions, and went home, and related how it had fared with him. Then the father sent Uele into the forest to make a boat of that kind. He worked diligently, and whistled all the time. At mid-day, when the sun was at the highest, came the little iron man and asked what he was making? Uele gave him for answer, \"Wooden bowls for the kitchen.\" The iron man said, \"So it shall be, and remain.\" By evening Uele thought he had now made the boat, but when he wanted to get into it, he had nothing but wooden bowls. The next day Seame went into the forest, but everything went with him just as it had done with Uele. On the third day Stupid Hans went. He worked away most industriously, so that the whole forest resounded with the heavy strokes, and all the while he sang and whistled right merrily. At mid-day, when it was the hottest, the little man came again, and asked what he was making? \"A boat which will go quicker on dry land than on the water,\" replied Hans, \" and when I have finished it, I am to have the King\'s daughter for my wife.\" - \"Well,\" said the little man, \"such an one shall it be, and remain.\" In the evening, when the sun had turned into gold, Hans finished his boat, and all that was wanted for it. He got into it and rowed to the palace. The boat went as swiftly as the wind. The King saw it from afar, but would not give his daughter to Hans yet, and said he must first take a hundred hares out to pasture from early morning until late evening, and if one of them got away, he should not have his daughter. Hans was contented with this, and the next day went with his flock to the pasture, and took great care that none of them ran away.\n\nBefore many hours had passed came a servant from the palace, and told Hans that he must give her a hare instantly, for some visitors had come unexpectedly. Hans, however, was very well aware what that meant, and said he would not give her one; the King might set some hare soup before his guest next day. The maid, however, would not believe in his refusal, and at last she began to get angry with him. Then Hans said that if the King\'s daughter came herself, he would give her a hare. The maid told this in the palace, and the daughter did go herself. In the meantime, however, the little man came again to Hans, and asked him what he was doing there? He said he had to watch over a hundred hares and see that none of them ran away, and then he might marry the King\'s daughter and be King. \"Good,\" said the little man, \"there is a whistle for thee, and if one of them runs away, just whistle with it, and then it will come back again.\" When the King\'s daughter came, Hans gave her a hare into her apron; but when she had gone about a hundred steps with it, he whistled, and the hare jumped out of the apron, and before she could turn round was back to the flock again. When the evening came the hare-herd whistled once more, and looked to see if all were there, and then drove them to the palace. The King wondered how Hans had been able to take a hundred hares to graze without losing any of them; he would, however, not give him his daughter yet, and said he must now bring him a feather from the Griffin\'s tail. Hans set out at once, and walked straight forwards. In the evening he came to a castle, and there he asked for a night\'s lodging, for at that time there were no inns. The lord of the castle promised him that with much pleasure, and asked where he was going? Hans answered, \"To the Griffin.\" - \"Oh! to the Griffin! They tell me he knows everything, and I have lost the key of an iron money-chest; so you might be so good as to ask him where it is.\" - \"Yes, indeed,\" said Hans, \"I will do that.\" Early the next morning he went onwards, and on his way arrived at another castle in which he again stayed the night. When the people who lived there learnt that he was going to the Griffin, they said they had in the house a daughter who was ill, and that they had already tried every means to cure her, but none of them had done her any good, and he might be so kind as to ask the Griffin what would make their daughter healthy again? Hans said he would willingly do that, and went onwards. Then he came to a lake, and instead of a ferry-boat, a tall, tall man was there who had to carry everybody across. The man asked Hans whither he was journeying? \"To the Griffin,\" said Hans. \"Then when you get to him,\" said the man, \"just ask him why I am forced to carry everybody over the lake.\" - \"Yes, indeed, most certainly I\'ll do that,\" said Hans. Then the man took him up on his shoulders, and carried him across. At length Hans arrived at the Griffin\'s house, but the wife only was at home, and not the Griffin himself. Then the woman asked him what he wanted? Thereupon he told her everything;—that he had to get a feather out of the Griffin\'s tail, and that there was a castle where they had lost the key of their money-chest, and he was to ask the Griffin where it was?—that in another castle the daughter was ill, and he was to learn what would cure her?—and then not far from thence there was a lake and a man beside it, who was forced to carry people across it, and he was very anxious to learn why the man was obliged to do it. Then said the woman, \"But look here, my good friend, no Christian can speak to the Griffin; he devours them all; but if you like, you can lie down under his bed, and in the night, when he is quite fast asleep, you can reach out and pull a feather out of his tail, and as for those things which you are to learn, I will ask about them myself.\" Hans was quite satisfied with this, and got under the bed. In the evening, the Griffin came home, and as soon as he entered the room, said, \"Wife, I smell a Christian.\" - \"Yes,\" said the woman, \"one was here to-day, but he went away again;\" and on that the Griffin said no more.\n\nIn the middle of the night when the Griffin was snoring loudly, Hans reached out and plucked a feather from his tail. The Griffin woke up instantly, and said, \"Wife, I smell a Christian, and it seems to me that somebody was pulling at my tail.\" His wife said, \"Thou hast certainly been dreaming, and I told thee before that a Christian was here to-day, but that he went away again. He told me all kinds of things that in one castle they had lost the key of their money-chest, and could find it nowhere.\" - \"Oh! the fools!\" said the Griffin; \"the key lies in the wood- house under a log of wood behind the door.\" - \"And then he said that in another castle the daughter was ill, and they knew no remedy that would cure her.\" - \"Oh! the fools!\" said the Griffin; \"under the cellar-steps a toad has made its nest of her hair, and if she got her hair back she would be well.\" - \"And then he also said that there was a place where there was a lake and a man beside it who was forced to carry everybody across.\" - \"Oh, the fool!\" said the Griffin; \"if he only put one man down in the middle, he would never have to carry another across.\" Early the next morning the Griffin got up and went out. Then Hans came forth from under the bed, and he had a beautiful feather, and had heard what the Griffin had said about the key, and the daughter, and the ferry-man. The Griffin\'s wife repeated it all once more to him that he might not forget it, and then he went home again. First he came to the man by the lake, who asked him what the Griffin had said, but Hans replied that he must first carry him across, and then he would tell him. So the man carried him across, and when he was over Hans told him that all he had to do was to set one person down in the middle of the lake, and then he would never have to carry over any more. The man was hugely delighted, and told Hans that out of gratitude he would take him once more across, and back again. But Hans said no, he would save him the trouble, he was quite satisfied already, and pursued his way. Then he came to the castle where the daughter was ill; he took her on his shoulders, for she could not walk, and carried her down the cellar-steps and pulled out the toad\'s nest from beneath the lowest step and gave it into her hand, and she sprang off his shoulder and up the steps before him, and was quite cured. Then were the father and mother beyond measure rejoiced, and they gave Hans gifts of gold and of silver, and whatsoever else he wished for, that they gave him. And when he got to the other castle he went at once into the wood- house, and found the key under the log of wood behind the door, and took it to the lord of the castle. He also was not a little pleased, and gave Hans as a reward much of the gold that was in the chest, and all kinds of things besides, such as cows, and sheep, and goats. When Hans arrived before the King, with all these things—with the money, and the gold, and the silver and the cows, sheep and goats, the King asked him how he had come by them. Then Hans told him that the Griffin gave every one whatsoever he wanted. So the King thought he himself could make such things useful, and set out on his way to the Griffin; but when he got to the lake, it happened that he was the very first who arrived there after Hans, and the man put him down in the middle of it and went away, and the King was drowned. Hans, however, married the daughter, and became King.\n</string>
    <string name="story281text">There once lived a girl who had three brothers. The boys meant everything to their mother, and the girl was always put at a disadvantage and treated badly. Every day she had to go out to a barren heath to dig peat, which was used for cooking and heating. A dull old tool was all she had for that nasty work.\n\nThe little girl had an admirer, an elf who lived in a hill near her mother\'s house. Whenever she passed by that hill, the elf would stretch his hand out of a boulder and hold out a very sharp knife that had special powers and could cut through anything. She was able to dig out the peat quickly with that knife, go home with the required amount, and when she got to the boulder, she tapped on it twice. The hand would then reach out to take back the knife.\n\nWhen the mother began to notice how quickly and effortlessly the girl brought home the peat, she told the brothers that someone else had to be helping her with the work, otherwise it wouldn\'t be possible. The brothers stealthily followed her and saw how she got the magical knife, then caught up with her and forced her to give it to them. They headed back, struck the rock as the girl had done, and when the good elf stretched his hand out, they cut it off with his own knife. The bloody arm pulled back, and because the elf believed that his beloved had betrayed him, he was never seen again.</string>
    <string name="story282text">Hans had served his master for seven years, so he said to him, \"Master, my time is up; now I should be glad to go back home to my mother; give me my wages.\" The master answered, \"You have served me faithfully and honestly; as the service was so shall the reward be;\" and he gave Hans a piece of gold as big as his head. Hans pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket, wrapped up the lump in it, put it on his shoulder, and set out on the way home.\nAs he went on, always putting one foot before the other, he saw a horseman trotting quickly and merrily by on a lively horse. \"Ah!\" said Hans quite loud, \"what a fine thing it is to ride! There you sit as on a chair; you stumble over no stones, you save your shoes, and get on, you don\'t know how.\"\n\nThe rider, who had heard him, stopped and called out, \"Hollo! Hans, why do you go on foot, then?\"\n\n\"I must,\" answered he, \"for I have this lump to carry home; it is true that it is gold, but I cannot hold my head straight for it, and it hurts my shoulder.\"\n\n\"I will tell you what,\" said the rider, \"we will exchange: I will give you my horse, and you can give me your lump.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said Hans, \"but I can tell you, you will have to crawl along with it.\"\n\nThe rider got down, took the gold, and helped Hans up; then gave him the bridle tight in his hands and said, \"If you want to go at a really good pace, you must click your tongue and call out, \"Jup! Jup!\"\n\nHans was heartily delighted as he sat upon the horse and rode away so bold and free. After a little while he thought that it ought to go faster, and he began to click with his tongue and call out, \"Jup! Jup!\" The horse put himself into a sharp trot, and before Hans knew where he was, he was thrown off and lying in a ditch which separated the field from the highway. The horse would have gone off too if it had not been stopped by a countryman, who was coming along the road and driving a cow before him.\n\nHans got his limbs together and stood up on his legs again, but he was vexed, and said to the countryman, \"It is a poor joke, this riding, especially when one gets hold of a mare like this, that kicks and throws one off, so that one has a chance of breaking one\'s neck. Never again will I mount it. Now I like your cow, for one can walk quietly behind her, and have, over and above, one\'s milk, butter and cheese every day without fail. What would I not give to have such a cow.\" - \"Well,\" said the countryman, \"if it would give you so much pleasure, I do not mind giving the cow for the horse.\" Hans agreed with the greatest delight; the countryman jumped upon the horse, and rode quickly away.\n\nHans drove his cow quietly before him, and thought over his lucky bargain. \"If only I have a morsel of bread — and that can hardly fail me — I can eat butter and cheese with it as often as I like; if I am thirsty, I can milk my cow and drink the milk. Good heart, what more can I want?\"\n\nWhen he came to an inn he made a halt, and in his great content ate up what he had with him — his dinner and supper — and all he had, and with his last few farthings had half a glass of beer. Then he drove his cow onwards along the road to his mother\'s village.\n\nAs it drew nearer mid-day, the heat was more oppressive, and Hans found himself upon a moor which it took about an hour to cross. He felt it very hot and his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth with thirst. \"I can find a cure for this,\" thought Hans; \"I will milk the cow now and refresh myself with the milk.\" He tied her to a withered tree, and as he had no pail he put his leather cap underneath; but try as he would, not a drop of milk came. And as he set himself to work in a clumsy way, the impatient beast at last gave him such a blow on his head with its hind foot, that he fell on the ground, and for a long time could not think where he was.\n\nBy good fortune a butcher just then came along the road with a wheel-barrow, in which lay a young pig. \"What sort of a trick is this?\" cried he, and helped the good Hans up. Hans told him what had happened. The butcher gave him his flask and said, \"Take a drink and refresh yourself. The cow will certainly give no milk, it is an old beast; at the best it is only fit for the plough, or for the butcher.\" - \"Well, well,\" said Hans, as he stroked his hair down on his head, \"who would have thought it? Certainly it is a fine thing when one can kill a beast like that at home; what meat one has! But I do not care much for beef, it is not juicy enough for me. A young pig like that now is the thing to have, it tastes quite different; and then there are the sausages!\"\n\n\"Hark ye, Hans,\" said the butcher, \"out of love for you I will exchange, and will let you have the pig for the cow.\" - \"Heaven repay you for your kindness!\" said Hans as he gave up the cow, whilst the pig was unbound from the barrow, and the cord by which it was tied was put in his hand.\n\nHans went on, and thought to himself how everything was going just as he wished; if he did meet with any vexation it was immediately set right. Presently there joined him a lad who was carrying a fine white goose under his arm. They said good morning to each other, and Hans began to tell of his good luck, and how he had always made such good bargains. The boy told him that he was taking the goose to a christening-feast. \"Just lift her,\" added he, and laid hold of her by the wings; \"how heavy she is — she has been fattened up for the last eight weeks. Whoever has a bit of her when she is roasted will have to wipe the fat from both sides of his mouth.\" - \"Yes,\" said Hans, as he weighed her in one hand, \"she is a good weight, but my pig is no bad one.\"\n\nMeanwhile the lad looked suspiciously from one side to the other, and shook his head. \"Look here,\" he said at length, \"it may not be all right with your pig. In the village through which I passed, the Mayor himself had just had one stolen out of its sty. I fear — I fear that you have got hold of it there. They have sent out some people and it would be a bad business if they caught you with the pig; at the very least, you would be shut up in the dark hole.\"\n\nThe good Hans was terrified. \"Goodness!\" he said, \"help me out of this fix; you know more about this place than I do, take my pig and leave me your goose.\" - \"I shall risk something at that game,\" answered the lad, \"but I will not be the cause of your getting into trouble.\" So he took the cord in his hand, and drove away the pig quickly along a by-path.\n\nThe good Hans, free from care, went homewards with the goose under his arm. \"When I think over it properly,\" said he to himself, \"I have even gained by the exchange; first there is the good roast-meat, then the quantity of fat which will drip from it, and which will give me dripping for my bread for a quarter of a year, and lastly the beautiful white feathers; I will have my pillow stuffed with them, and then indeed I shall go to sleep without rocking. How glad my mother will be!\"\n\nAs he was going through the last village, there stood a scissors-grinder with his barrow; as his wheel whirred he sang —\n\n\"I sharpen scissors and quickly grind,\nMy coat blows out in the wind behind.\"\nHans stood still and looked at him; at last he spoke to him and said, \"All\'s well with you, as you are so merry with your grinding.\" - \"Yes,\" answered the scissors-grinder, \"the trade has a golden foundation. A real grinder is a man who as often as he puts his hand into his pocket finds gold in it. But where did you buy that fine goose?\"\n\"I did not buy it, but exchanged my pig for it.\"\n\n\"And the pig?\"\n\n\"That I got for a cow.\"\n\n\"And the cow?\"\n\n\"I took that instead of a horse.\"\n\n\"And the horse?\"\n\n\"For that I gave a lump of gold as big as my head.\"\n\n\"And the gold?\"\n\n\"Well, that was my wages for seven years\' service.\"\n\n\"You have known how to look after yourself each time,\" said the grinder. \"If you can only get on so far as to hear the money jingle in your pocket whenever you stand up, you will have made your fortune.\"\n\n\"How shall I manage that?\" said Hans. \"You must be a grinder, as I am; nothing particular is wanted for it but a grindstone, the rest finds itself. I have one here; it is certainly a little worn, but you need not give me anything for it but your goose; will you do it?\"\n\n\"How can you ask?\" answered Hans. \"I shall be the luckiest fellow on earth; if I have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket, what need I trouble about any longer?\" and he handed him the goose and received the grindstone in exchange. \"Now,\" said the grinder, as he took up an ordinary heavy stone that lay by him, \"here is a strong stone for you into the bargain; you can hammer well upon it, and straighten your old nails. Take it with you and keep it carefully.\"\n\nHans loaded himself with the stones, and went on with a contented heart; his eyes shone with joy. \"I must have been born with a caul,\" he cried; \"everything I want happens to me just as if I were a Sunday-child.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as he had been on his legs since daybreak, he began to feel tired. Hunger also tormented him, for in his joy at the bargain by which he got the cow he had eaten up all his store of food at once. At last he could only go on with great trouble, and was forced to stop every minute; the stones, too, weighed him down dreadfully. Then he could not help thinking how nice it would be if he had not to carry them just then.\n\nHe crept like a snail to a well in a field, and there he thought that he would rest and refresh himself with a cool draught of water, but in order that he might not injure the stones in sitting down, he laid them carefully by his side on the edge of the well. Then he sat down on it, and was to stoop and drink, when he made a slip, pushed against the stones, and both of them fell into the water. When Hans saw them with his own eyes sinking to the bottom, he jumped for joy, and then knelt down, and with tears in his eyes thanked God for having shown him this favour also, and delivered him in so good a way, and without his having any need to reproach himself, from those heavy stones which had been the only things that troubled him.\n\n\"There is no man under the sun so fortunate as I,\" he cried out. With a light heart and free from every burden he now ran on until he was with his mother at home.</string>
    <string name="story284text">There was once a countryman who had money and land in plenty, but how rich soever he was, one thing was still wanting in his happiness he had no children. Often when he went into the town with the other peasants they mocked him and asked why he had no children. At last he became angry, and when he got home he said, \"I will have a child, even if it be a hedgehog.\" Then his wife had a child, that was a hedgehog in the upper part of his body, and a boy in the lower, and when she saw the child, she was terrified, and said, \"See, there thou hast brought ill-luck on us.\" Then said the man, \"What can be done now? The boy must be christened, but we shall not be able to get a godfather for him.\" The woman said, \"And we cannot call him anything else but Hans-my-Hedgehog.\" When he was christened, the parson said, \"He cannot go into any ordinary bed because of his spikes.\" So a little straw was put behind the stove, and Hans-my-Hedgehog was laid on it. His mother could not suckle him, for he would have pricked her with his quills. So he lay there behind the stove for eight years, and his father was tired of him and thought, \"If he would but die!\" He did not die, however, but remained lying there. Now it happened that there was a fair in the town, and the peasant was about to go to it, and asked his wife what he should bring back with him for her. \"A little meat and a couple of white rolls which are wanted for the house,\" said she. Then he asked the servant, and she wanted a pair of slippers and some stockings with clocks. At last he said also, \"And what wilt thou have, Hans my Hedgehog?\" - \"Dear father,\" he said, \"do bring me bagpipes.\" When, therefore, the father came home again, he gave his wife what he had bought for her; meat and white rolls, and then he gave the maid the slippers, and the stockings with clocks; and, lastly, he went behind the stove, and gave Hans-my-Hedgehog the bagpipes. And when Hans-my-Hedgehog had the bagpipes, he said, \"Dear father, do go to the forge and get the cock shod, and then I will ride away, and never come back again.\" On this, the father was delighted to think that he was going to get rid of him, and had the cock shod for him, and when it was done, Hans-my-Hedgehog got on it, and rode away, but took swine and asses with him which he intended to keep in the forest. When they got there he made the cock fly on to a high tree with him, and there he sat for many a long year, and watched his asses and swine until the herd was quite large, and his father knew nothing about him. While he was sitting in the tree, however, he played his bagpipes, and made music which was very beautiful. Once a King came travelling by who had lost his way and heard the music. He was astonished at it, and sent his servant forth to look all round and see from whence this music came. He spied about, but saw nothing but a little animal sitting up aloft on the tree, which looked like a cock with a hedgehog on it which made this music. Then the King told the servant he was to ask why he sat there, and if he knew the road which led to his kingdom. So Hans-my-Hedgehog descended from the tree, and said he would show the way if the King would write a bond and promise him whatever he first met in the royal courtyard as soon as he arrived at home. Then the King thought, \"I can easily do that, Hans-my-Hedgehog understands nothing, and I can write what I like.\" So the King took pen and ink and wrote something, and when he had done it, Hans-my-Hedgehog showed him the way, and he got safely home. But his daughter, when she saw him from afar, was so overjoyed that she ran to meet him, and kissed him. Then he remembered Hans-my-Hedgehog, and told her what had happened, and that he had been forced to promise whatsoever first met him when he got home, to a very strange animal which sat on a cock as if it were a horse, and made beautiful music, but that instead of writing that he should have what he wanted, he had written that he should not have it. Thereupon the princess was glad, and said he had done well, for she never would have gone away with the Hedgehog.\n\nHans-my-Hedgehog, however, looked after his asses and pigs, and was always merry and sat on the tree and played his bagpipes. Now it came to pass that another King came journeying by with his attendants and runners, and he also had lost his way, and did not know how to get home again because the forest was so large. He likewise heard the beautiful music from a distance, and asked his runner what that could be, and told him to go and see. Then the runner went under the tree, and saw the cock sitting at the top of it, and Hans-my-Hedgehog on the cock. The runner asked him what he was about up there? \"I am keeping my asses and my pigs; but what is your desire?\" The messenger said that they had lost their way, and could not get back into their own kingdom, and asked if he would not show them the way. Then Hans-my-Hedgehog got down the tree with the cock, and told the aged King that he would show him the way, if he would give him for his own whatsoever first met him in front of his royal palace. The King said, \"Yes,\" and wrote a promise to Hans-my-Hedgehog that he should have this. That done, Hans rode on before him on the cock, and pointed out the way, and the King reached his kingdom again in safety. When he got to the courtyard, there were great rejoicings. Now he had an only daughter who was very beautiful; she ran to meet him, threw her arms round his neck, and was delighted to have her old father back again. She asked him where in the world he had been so long. So he told her how he had lost his way, and had very nearly not come back at all, but that as he was travelling through a great forest, a creature, half hedgehog, half man, who was sitting astride a cock in a high tree, and making music, had shown him the way and helped him to get out, but that in return he had promised him whatsoever first met him in the royal court-yard, and how that was she herself, which made him unhappy now. But on this she promised that, for love of her father, she would willingly go with this Hans if he came.\n\nHans-my-Hedgehog, however, took care of his pigs, and the pigs multiplied until they became so many in number that the whole forest was filled with them. Then Hans-my-Hedgehog resolved not to live in the forest any longer, and sent word to his father to have every stye in the village emptied, for he was coming with such a great herd that all might kill who wished to do so. When his father heard that, he was troubled, for he thought Hans-my-Hedgehog had died long ago. Hans-my-Hedgehog, however, seated himself on the cock, and drove the pigs before him into the village, and ordered the slaughter to begin. Ha! but there was a killing and a chopping that might have been heard two miles off! After this Hans-my-Hedgehog said, \"Father, let me have the cock shod once more at the forge, and then I will ride away and never come back as long as I live.\" Then the father had the cock shod once more, and was pleased that Hans-my-Hedgehog would never return again.\n\nHans-my-Hedgehog rode away to the first kingdom. There the King had commanded that whosoever came mounted on a cock and had bagpipes with him should be shot at, cut down, or stabbed by everyone, so that he might not enter the palace. When, therefore, Hans-my-Hedgehog came riding thither, they all pressed forward against him with their pikes, but he spurred the cock and it flew up over the gate in front of the King\'s window and lighted there, and Hans cried that the King must give him what he had promised, or he would take both his life and his daughter\'s. Then the King began to speak his daughter fair, and to beg her to go away with Hans in order to save her own life and her father\'s. So she dressed herself in white, and her father gave her a carriage with six horses and magnificent attendants together with gold and possessions. She seated herself in the carriage, and placed Hans-my-Hedgehog beside her with the cock and the bagpipes, and then they took leave and drove away, and the King thought he should never see her again. He was however, deceived in his expectation, for when they were at a short distance from the town, Hans-my-Hedgehog took her pretty clothes off, and pierced her with his hedgehog\'s skin until she bled all over. \"That is the reward of your falseness,\" said he. \"go your way, I will not have you!\" and on that he chased her home again, and she was disgraced for the rest of her life.\n\nHans-my-Hedgehog, however, rode on further on the cock, with his bagpipes, to the dominions of the second King to whom he had shown the way. This one, however, had arranged that if any one resembling Hans-my-Hedgehog should come, they were to present arms, give him safe conduct, cry long life to him, and lead him to the royal palace. But when the King\'s daughter saw him she was terrified, for he looked quite too strange. She remembered however, that she could not change her mind, for she had given her promise to her father. So Hans-my-Hedgehog was welcomed by her, and married to her, and had to go with her to the royal table, and she seated herself by his side, and they ate and drank. When the evening came and they wanted to go to sleep, she was afraid of his quills, but he told her she was not to fear, for no harm would befall her, and he told the old King that he was to appoint four men to watch by the door of the chamber, and light a great fire, and when he entered the room and was about to get into bed, he would creep out of his hedgehog\'s skin and leave it lying there by the bedside, and that the men were to run nimbly to it, throw it in the fire, and stay by it until it was consumed. When the clock struck eleven, he went into the chamber, stripped off the hedgehog\'s skin, and left it lying by the bed. Then came the men and fetched it swiftly, and threw it in the fire; and when the fire had consumed it, he was delivered, and lay there in bed in human form, but he was coal-black as if he had been burnt. The King sent for his physician who washed him with precious salves, and anointed him, and he became white, and was a handsome young man. When the King\'s daughter saw that she was glad, and the next morning they arose joyfully, ate and drank, and then the marriage was properly solemnized, and Hans-my-Hedgehog received the kingdom from the aged King.\n\nWhen several years had passed he went with his wife to his father, and said that he was his son. The father, however, declared he had no son he had never had but one, and he had been born like a hedgehog with spikes, and had gone forth into the world. Then Hans made himself known, and the old father rejoiced and went with him to his kingdom.</string>
    <string name="story285text">Near a great forest there lived a poor woodcutter and his wife, and his two children; the boy\'s name was Hansel and the girl\'s Grethel. They had very little to bite or to sup, and once, when there was great dearth in the land, the man could not even gain the daily bread. As he lay in bed one night thinking of this, and turning and tossing, he sighed heavily, and said to his wife, \"What will become of us? we cannot even feed our children; there is nothing left for ourselves.\"\n\n\"I will tell you what, husband,\" answered the wife; \"we will take the children early in the morning into the forest, where it is thickest; we will make them a fire, and we will give each of them a piece of bread, then we will go to our work and leave them alone; they will never find the way home again, and we shall be quit of them.\"\n\n\"No, wife,\" said the man, \"I cannot do that; I cannot find in my heart to take my children into the forest and to leave them there alone; the wild animals would soon come and devour them.\" - \"O you fool,\" said she, \"then we will all four starve; you had better get the coffins ready,\" and she left him no peace until he consented. \"But I really pity the poor children,\" said the man.\n\nThe two children had not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Grethel wept bitterly, and said to Hansel, \"It is all over with us.\"\n\n\"Do be quiet, Grethel,\" said Hansel, \"and do not fret; 1 will manage something.\" And when the parents had gone to sleep he got up, put on his little coat, opened the back door, and slipped out. The moon was shining brightly, and the white flints that lay in front of the house glistened like pieces of silver. Hansel stooped and filled the little pocket of his coat as full as it would hold. Then he went back again, and said to Grethel, \"Be easy, dear little sister, and go to sleep quietly; God will not forsake us,\" and laid himself down again in his bed. When the day was breaking, and before the sun had risen, the wife came and awakened the two children, saying, \"Get up, you lazy bones; we are going into the forest to cut wood.\" Then she gave each of them a piece of bread, and said, \"That is for dinner, and you must not eat it before then, for you will get no more.\" Grethel carried the bread under her apron, for Hansel had his pockets full of the flints. Then they set off all together on their way to the forest. When they had gone a little way Hansel stood still and looked back towards the house, and this he did again and again, till his father said to him, \"Hansel, what are you looking at? take care not to forget your legs.\"\n\n\"O father,\" said Hansel, \"lam looking at my little white kitten, who is sitting up on the roof to bid me good-bye.\" - \"You young fool,\" said the woman, \"that is not your kitten, but the sunshine on the chimney-pot.\" Of course Hansel had not been looking at his kitten, but had been taking every now and then a flint from his pocket and dropping it on the road. When they reached the middle of the forest the father told the children to collect wood to make a fire to keep them, warm; and Hansel and Grethel gathered brushwood enough for a little mountain j and it was set on fire, and when the flame was burning quite high the wife said, \"Now lie down by the fire and rest yourselves, you children, and we will go and cut wood; and when we are ready we will come and fetch you.\"\n\nSo Hansel and Grethel sat by the fire, and at noon they each ate their pieces of bread. They thought their father was in the wood all the time, as they seemed to hear the strokes of the axe: but really it was only a dry branch hanging to a withered tree that the wind moved to and fro. So when they had stayed there a long time their eyelids closed with weariness, and they fell fast asleep.\n\nWhen at last they woke it was night, and Grethel began to cry, and said, \"How shall we ever get out of this wood? \"But Hansel comforted her, saying, \"Wait a little while longer, until the moon rises, and then we can easily find the way home.\" And when the full moon got up Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the way where the flint stones shone like silver, and showed them the road. They walked on the whole night through, and at the break of day they came to their father\'s house. They knocked at the door, and when the wife opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Grethel she said, \"You naughty children, why did you sleep so long in the wood? we thought you were never coming home again!\" But the father was glad, for it had gone to his heart to leave them both in the woods alone.\n\nNot very long after that there was again great scarcity in those parts, and the children heard their mother say at night in bed to their father, \"Everything is finished up; we have only half a loaf, and after that the tale comes to an end. The children must be off; we will take them farther into the wood this time, so that they shall not be able to find the way back again; there is no other way to manage.\" The man felt sad at heart, and he thought, \"It would better to share one\'s last morsel with one\'s children.\" But the wife would listen to nothing that he said, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B too, and when a man has given in once he has to do it a second time.\n\nBut the children were not asleep, and had heard all the talk. When the parents had gone to sleep Hansel got up to go out and get more flint stones, as he did before, but the wife had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out; but he comforted his little sister, and said, \"Don\'t cry, Grethel, and go to sleep quietly, and God will help us.\" Early the next morning the wife came and pulled the children out of bed. She gave them each a little piece of \"bread -less than before; and on the way to the wood Hansel crumbled the bread in his pocket, and often stopped to throw a crumb on the ground. \"Hansel, what are you stopping behind and staring for?\" said the father.\n\n\"I am looking at my little pigeon sitting on the roof, to say good-bye to me,\" answered Hansel. \"You fool,\" said the wife, \"that is no pigeon, but the morning sun shining on the chimney pots.\" Hansel went on as before, and strewed bread crumbs all along the road. The woman led the children far into the wood, where they had never been before in all their lives. And again there was a large fire made, and the mother said, \"Sit still there, you children, and when you are tired you can go to sleep; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening, when we are ready to go home we will come and fetch you.\"\n\nSo when noon came Grethel shared her bread with Hansel, who had strewed his along the road. Then they went to sleep, and the evening passed, and no one came for the poor children. When they awoke it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister, and said, \"Wait a little, Grethel, until the moon gets up, then we shall be able to see the way home by the crumbs of bread that I have scattered along it.\"\n\nSo when the moon rose they got up, but they could find no crumbs of bread, for the birds of the woods and of the fields had come and picked them up. Hansel thought they might find the way all the same, but they could not. They went on all that night, and the next day from the morning until the evening, but they could not find the way out of the wood, and they were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but the few berries they could pick up. And when they were so tired that they could no longer drag themselves along, they lay down under a tree and fell asleep.\n\nIt was now the third morning since they had left their father\'s house. They were always trying to get back to it, but instead of that they only found themselves farther in the wood, and if help had not soon come they would have been starved.\n\nAbout noon they saw a pretty snow-white bird sitting on a bough, and singing so sweetly that they stopped to listen. And when he had finished the bird spread his wings and flew before them, and they followed after him until they came to a little house, and the bird perched on the roof, and when they came nearer they saw that the house was built of bread, and roofed with cakes; and the window was of transparent sugar. \"We will have some of this,\" said Hansel, \"and make a fine meal. I will eat a piece of the roof, Grethel, and you can have some of the window-that will taste sweet.\" So Hansel reached up and broke off a bit of the roof, just to see how it tasted, and Grethel stood by the window and gnawed at it. Then they heard a thin voice call out from inside,\n\n\"Nibble, nibble, like a mouse,\nWho is nibbling at my house?\"\n\nAnd the children answered,\n\n\"Never mind, It is the wind.\"\n\nAnd they went on eating, never disturbing themselves. Hansel, who found that the roof tasted very nice, took down a great piece of it, and Grethel pulled out a large round window-pane, and sat her down and began upon it.\n\nThen the door opened, and an aged woman came out, leaning upon a crutch. Hansel and Grethel felt very frightened, and let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said, \"Ah, my dear children, how come you here? you must come indoors and stay with me, you will be no trouble.\" So she took them each by the hand, and led them into her little house. And there they found a good meal laid out, of milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. After that she showed them two little white beds, and Hansel and Grethel laid themselves down on them, and thought they were in heaven.\n\nThe old woman, although her behaviour was so kind, was a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had built the little house on purpose to entice them. When they were once inside she used to kill them, cook them, and eat them, and then it was a feast day with her. The witch\'s eyes were red, and she could not see very far, but she had a keen scent, like the beasts, and knew very well when human creatures were near. When she knew that Hansel and Grethel were coming, she gave a spiteful laugh, and said triumphantly, \"I have them, and they shall not escape me!\"\n\nEarly in the morning, before the children were awake, she got up to look at them, and as they lay sleeping so peacefully with round rosy cheeks, she said to herself, \"What a fine feast I shall have!\" Then she grasped Hansel with her withered hand, and led him into a little stable, and shut him up behind a grating; and call and scream as he might, it was no good. Then she went back to Grethel and shook her, crying, \"Get up, lazy bones; fetch water, and cook something nice for your brother; he is outside in the stable, and must be fattened up. And when he is fat enough I will eat him.\" Grethel began to weep bitterly, but it was of no use, she had to do what the wicked witch bade her. And so the best kind of victuals was cooked for poor Hansel, while Grethel got nothing but crab-shells.\n\nEach morning the old woman visited the little stable, and cried, \"Hansel, stretch out your finger, that I may tell if you will soon be fat enough.\" Hansel, however, used to hold out a little bone, and the old woman, who had weak eyes, could not see what it was, and supposing it to be Hansel\'s finger, wondered very much that it was not getting fatter.\n\nWhen four weeks had passed and Hansel seemed to remain so thin, she lost patience and could wait no longer. \"Now then, Grethel,\" cried she to the little girl; \"be quick and draw water; be Hansel fat or be he lean, tomorrow I must kill and cook him.\" Oh what a grief for the poor little sister to have to fetch water, and how the tears flowed down over her cheeks! \"Dear God, pray help us!\" cried she; \"if we had been devoured by wild beasts in the wood at least we should have died together.\"\n\n\"Spare me your lamentations,\" said the old woman; \"they are of no avail.\" Early next morning Grethel had to get up, make the fire, and fill the kettle. \"First we will do the baking,\" said the old woman; \"I nave heated the oven already, and kneaded the dough.\" She pushed poor Grethel towards the oven, out of which the flames were already shining.\n\n\"Creep in,\" said the witch, \"and see if it is properly hot, so that the bread may be baked.\" And Grethel once in, she meant to shut the door upon her and let her be baked, and then she would have eaten her. But Grethel perceived her intention, and said, \"I don\'t know how to do it: how shall I get in?\"\n\n\"Stupid goose,\" said the old woman, \"the opening is big enough, do you see? I could get in myself!\" and she stooped down and put her head in the oven\'s mouth. Then Grethel gave her a push, so that she went in farther, and she shut the iron door upon her, and put up the bar. Oh how frightfully she howled! but Grethel ran away, and left the wicked witch to burn miserably.\n\nGrethel went straight to Hansel, opened the stable-door, and cried, \"Hansel, we are free! the old witch is dead!\" Then out flew Hansel like a bird from its cage as soon as the door is opened. How rejoiced they both were! how they fell each on the other\'s neck! and danced about, and kissed each other! And as they had nothing more to fear they went over all the old witch\'s house, and in every corner there stood chests of pearls and precious stones. \"This is something better than flint stones,\" said Hansel, as he filled his pockets, and Grethel, thinking she also would like to carry something home with her, filled her apron full. i! Now, away we go,\" said Hansel, \"if we only can get out of the witch\'s wood.\" When they had journeyed a few hours they came to a great piece of water. \"We can never get across this,\" said Hansel, \"I see no stepping-stones and no bridge.\"\n\n\"And there is no boat either,\" said Grethel; \"but here comes a white duck; if I ask her she will help us over.\" So she cried,\n\n\"Duck, duck, here we stand,\nHansel and Grethel, on the land,\nStepping-stones and bridge we lack,\nCarry us over on your nice white back.\"\n\nAnd the duck came accordingly, and Hansel got upon her and told his sister to come too. \"No,\" answered Grethel, \"that would be too hard upon the duck; we can go separately, one after the other.\" And that was how it was managed, and after that they went on happily, until they came to the wood, and the way grew more and more familiar, till at last they saw in the distance their father\'s house. Then they ran till they came up to it, rushed in at the door, and fell on their father\'s neck. The man had not had a quiet hour since he left his children in the wood; but the wife was dead. And when Grethel opened her apron the pearls and precious stones were scattered all over the room, and Hansel took one handful after another out of his pocket. Then was all care at an end, and they lived in great joy together. My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.</string>
    <string name="story286text">In a large town there was an old woman who sat in the evening alone in her room thinking how she had lost first her husband, then both her children, then one by one all her relations, and at length, that very day, her last friend, and now she was quite alone and desolate. She was very sad at heart, and heaviest of all her losses to her was that of her sons; and in her pain she blamed God for it. She was still sitting lost in thought, when all at once she heard the bells ringing for early prayer. She was surprised that she had thus in her sorrow watched through the whole night, and lighted her lantern and went to church. It was already lighted up when she arrived, but not as it usually was with wax candles, but with a dim light. It was also crowded already with people, and all the seats were filled; and when the old woman got to her usual place it also was not empty, but the whole bench was entirely full. And when she looked at the people, they were none other than her dead relations who were sitting there in their old-fashioned garments, but with pale faces. They neither spoke nor sang; but a soft humming and whispering was heard all over the church. Then an aunt of hers stood up, stepped forward, and said to the poor old woman, \"Look there beside the altar, and thou wilt see thy sons.\" The old woman looked there, and saw her two children, one hanging on the gallows, the other bound to the wheel. Then said the aunt, \"Behold, so would it have been with them if they had lived, and if the good God had not taken them to himself when they were innocent children.\" The old woman went trembling home, and on her knees thanked God for having dealt with her more kindly than she had been able to understand, and on the third day she lay down and died.</string>
    <string name="story287text">There was once on a time a King who had a wife with golden hair, and she was so beautiful that her equal was not to be found on earth. It came to pass that she lay ill, and as she felt that she must soon die, she called the King and said, \"If thou wishest to marry again after my death, take no one who is not quite as beautiful as I am, and who has not just such golden hair as I have: this thou must promise me.\" And after the King had promised her this she closed her eyes and died.\nFor a long time the King could not be comforted, and had no thought of taking another wife. At length his councillors said, \"There is no help for it, the King must marry again, that we may have a Queen.\" And now messengers were sent about far and wide, to seek a bride who equalled the late Queen in beauty. In the whole world, however, none was to be found, and even if one had been found, still there would have been no one who had such golden hair. So the messengers came home as they went.\n\nNow the King had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her dead mother, and had the same golden hair. When she was grown up the King looked at her one day, and saw that in every respect she was like his late wife, and suddenly felt a violent love for her. Then he spake to his councillors, \"I will marry my daughter, for she is the counterpart of my late wife, otherwise I can find no bride who resembles her.\" When the councillors heard that, they were shocked, and said, \"God has forbidden a father to marry his daughter, no good can come from such a crime, and the kingdom will be involved in the ruin.\"\n\nThe daughter was still more shocked when she became aware of her father\'s resolution, but hoped to turn him from his design. Then she said to him, \"Before I fulfil your wish, I must have three dresses, one as golden as the sun, one as silvery as the moon, and one as bright as the stars; besides this, I wish for a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur and hair joined together, and one of every kind of animal in your kingdom must give a piece of his skin for it.\" But she thought, \"To get that will be quite impossible, and thus I shall divert my father from his wicked intentions.\" The King, however, did not give it up, and the cleverest maidens in his kingdom had to weave the three dresses, one as golden as the sun, one as silvery as the moon, and one as bright as the stars, and his huntsmen had to catch one of every kind of animal in the whole of his kingdom, and take from it a piece of its skin, and out of these was made a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur. At length, when all was ready, the King caused the mantle to be brought, spread it out before her, and said, \"The wedding shall be to-morrow.\"\n\nWhen, therefore, the King\'s daughter saw that there was no longer any hope of turning her father\'s heart, she resolved to run away from him. In the night whilst every one was asleep, she got up, and took three different things from her treasures, a golden ring, a golden spinning-wheel, and a golden reel. The three dresses of the sun, moon, and stars she put into a nutshell, put on her mantle of all kinds of fur, and blackened her face and hands with soot. Then she commended herself to God, and went away, and walked the whole night until she reached a great forest. And as she was tired, she got into a hollow tree, and fell asleep.\n\nThe sun rose, and she slept on, and she was still sleeping when it was full day. Then it so happened that the King to whom this forest belonged, was hunting in it. When his dogs came to the tree, they sniffed, and ran barking round about it. The King said to the huntsmen, \"Just see what kind of wild beast has hidden itself in there.\" The huntsmen obeyed his order, and when they came back they said, \"A wondrous beast is lying in the hollow tree; we have never before seen one like it. Its skin is fur of a thousand different kinds, but it is lying asleep.\" Said the King, \"See if you can catch it alive, and then fasten it to the carriage, and we will take it with us.\" When the huntsmen laid hold of the maiden, she awoke full of terror, and cried to them, \"I am a poor child, deserted by father and mother; have pity on me, and take me with you.\" Then said they, \"Allerleirauh, thou wilt be useful in the kitchen, come with us, and thou canst sweep up the ashes.\" So they put her in the carriage, and took her home to the royal palace. There they pointed out to her a closet under the stairs, where no daylight entered, and said, \"Hairy animal, there canst thou live and sleep.\" Then she was sent into the kitchen, and there she carried wood and water, swept the hearth, plucked the fowls, picked the vegetables, raked the ashes, and did all the dirty work.\n\nAllerleirauh lived there for a long time in great wretchedness. Alas, fair princess, what is to become of thee now! It happened, however, that one day a feast was held in the palace, and she said to the cook, \"May I go up-stairs for a while, and look on? I will place myself outside the door.\" The cook answered, \"Yes, go, but you must be back here in half-an-hour to sweep the hearth.\" Then she took her oil-lamp, went into her den, put off her fur-dress, and washed the soot off her face and hands, so that her full beauty once more came to light. And she opened the nut, and took out her dress which shone like the sun, and when she had done that she went up to the festival, and every one made way for her, for no one knew her, and thought no otherwise than that she was a king\'s daughter. The King came to meet her, gave his hand to her, and danced with her, and thought in his heart, \"My eyes have never yet seen any one so beautiful!\" When the dance was over she curtsied, and when the King looked round again she had vanished, and none knew whither. The guards who stood outside the palace were called and questioned, but no one had seen her.\n\nShe had, however, run into her little den, had quickly taken off her dress, made her face and hands black again, put on the fur-mantle, and again was Allerleirauh. And now when she went into the kitchen, and was about to get to her work and sweep up the ashes, the cook said, \"Leave that alone till morning, and make me the soup for the King; I, too, will go upstairs awhile, and take a look; but let no hairs fall in, or in future thou shalt have nothing to eat.\" So the cook went away, and Allerleirauh made the soup for the king, and made bread soup and the best she could, and when it was ready she fetched her golden ring from her little den, and put it in the bowl in which the soup was served. When the dancing was over, the King had his soup brought and ate it, and he liked it so much that it seemed to him he had never tasted better. But when he came to the bottom of the bowl, he saw a golden ring lying, and could not conceive how it could have got there. Then he ordered the cook to appear before him. The cook was terrified when he heard the order, and said to Allerleirauh, \"Thou hast certainly let a hair fall into the soup, and if thou hast, thou shalt be beaten for it.\" When he came before the King the latter asked who had made the soup? The cook replied, \"I made it.\" But the King said, \"That is not true, for it was much better than usual, and cooked differently.\" He answered, \"I must acknowledge that I did not make it, it was made by the rough animal.\" The King said, \"Go and bid it come up here.\"\n\nWhen Allerleirauh came, the King said, \"Who art thou?\" - \"I am a poor girl who no longer has any father or mother.\" He asked further, \"Of what use art thou in my palace?\" She answered, \"I am good for nothing but to have boots thrown at my head.\" He continued, \"Where didst thou get the ring which was in the soup?\" She answered, \"I know nothing about the ring.\" So the King could learn nothing, and had to send her away again.\n\nAfter a while, there was another festival, and then, as before, Allerleirauh begged the cook for leave to go and look on. He answered, \"Yes, but come back again in half-an-hour, and make the King the bread soup which he so much likes.\" Then she ran into her den, washed herself quickly, and took out of the nut the dress which was as silvery as the moon, and put it on. Then she went up and was like a princess, and the King stepped forward to meet her, and rejoiced to see her once more, and as the dance was just beginning they danced it together. But when it was ended, she again disappeared so quickly that the King could not observe where she went. She, however, sprang into her den, and once more made herself a hairy animal, and went into the kitchen to prepare the bread soup. When the cook had gone up-stairs, she fetched the little golden spinning-wheel, and put it in the bowl so that the soup covered it. Then it was taken to the King, who ate it, and liked it as much as before, and had the cook brought, who this time likewise was forced to confess that Allerleirauh had prepared the soup. Allerleirauh again came before the King, but she answered that she was good for nothing else but to have boots thrown at her head, and that she knew nothing at all about the little golden spinning-wheel.\n\nWhen, for the third time, the King held a festival, all happened just as it had done before. The cook said, \"Faith rough-skin, thou art a witch, and always puttest something in the soup which makes it so good that the King likes it better than that which I cook,\" but as she begged so hard, he let her go up at the appointed time. And now she put on the dress which shone like the stars, and thus entered the hall. Again the King danced with the beautiful maiden, and thought that she never yet had been so beautiful. And whilst she was dancing, he contrived, without her noticing it, to slip a golden ring on her finger, and he had given orders that the dance should last a very long time. When it was ended, he wanted to hold her fast by her hands, but she tore herself loose, and sprang away so quickly through the crowd that she vanished from his sight. She ran as fast as she could into her den beneath the stairs, but as she had been too long, and had stayed more than half-an-hour she could not take off her pretty dress, but only threw over it her fur-mantle, and in her haste she did not make herself quite black, but one finger remained white. Then Allerleirauh ran into the kitchen, and cooked the bread soup for the King, and as the cook was away, put her golden reel into it. When the King found the reel at the bottom of it, he caused Allerleirauh to be summoned, and then he espied the white finger, and saw the ring which he had put on it during the dance. Then he grasped her by the hand, and held her fast, and when she wanted to release herself and run away, her mantle of fur opened a little, and the star-dress shone forth. The King clutched the mantle and tore it off. Then her golden hair shone forth, and she stood there in full splendour, and could no longer hide herself. And when she had washed the soot and ashes from her face, she was more beautiful than anyone who had ever been seen on earth. But the King said, \"Thou art my dear bride, and we will never more part from each other.\" Thereupon the marriage was solemnized, and they lived happily until their death.</string>
    <string name="story288text">Long time ago, perhaps as much as two thousand years, there was a rich man, and he had a beautiful and pious wife, and they loved each other very much, and they had no children, though they wished greatly for some, and the wife prayed for one day and night. Now, in the courtyard in front of their house stood an almond tree; and one day in winter the wife was standing beneath it, and paring an apple, and as she pared it she cut her finger, and the blood fell upon the snow. \"Ah,\" said the woman, sighing deeply, and looking down at the blood, \"if only I could have a child as red as blood, and as white as snow!\" And as she said these words, her heart suddenly grew light, and she felt sure she should have her wish. So she went back to the house, and when a month had passed the snow was gone; in two months everything was green; in three months the flowers sprang out of the earth; in four months the trees were in full leaf, and the branches were thickly entwined; the little birds began to sing, so that the woods echoed, and the blossoms fell from the trees; when the fifth month had passed the wife stood under the almond tree, and it smelt so sweet that her heart leaped within her, and she fell on her knees for joy; and when the sixth month had gone, the fruit was thick and fine, and she remained still; and the seventh month she gathered the almonds, and ate them eagerly, and was sick and sorrowful; and when the eighth month had passed she called to her husband, and said, weeping, \"If I die, bury me under the almond tree.\" Then she was comforted and happy until the ninth month had passed, and then she bore a child as white as snow and as red as blood, and when she saw it her joy was so great that she died.\n\nHer husband buried her under the almond tree, and he wept sore; time passed, and he became less sad; and after he had grieved a little more he left off, and then he took another wife.\n\nHis second wife bore him a daughter, and his first wife\'s child was a son, as red as blood and as white as snow. Whenever the wife looked at her daughter she felt great love for her, but whenever she looked at the little boy, evil thoughts came into her heart, of how she could get all her husband\'s money for her daughter, and how the boy stood in the way; and so she took great hatred to him, and drove him from one corner to another, and gave him a buffet here and a cuff there, so that the poor child was always in disgrace; when he came back after school hours there was no peace for him. Once, when the wife went into the room upstairs, her little daughter followed her, and said, \"Mother, give me an apple.\" - \"Yes, my child,\" said the mother, and gave her a fine apple out of the chest, and the chest had a great heavy lid with a strong iron lock. \"Mother,\" said the little girl, \"shall not my brother have one too?\" That was what the mother expected, and she said, \"Yes, when he comes back from school.\" And when she saw from the window that he was coming, an evil thought crossed her mind, and she snatched the apple, and took it from her little daughter, saying, \"You shall not have it before your brother.\" Then she threw the apple into the chest, and shut to the lid. Then the little boy came in at the door, and she said to him in a kind tone, but with evil looks, \"My son, will you have an apple?\" - \"Mother,\" said the boy, \"how terrible you look! yes, give me an apple!\" Then she spoke as kindly as before, holding up the cover of the chest, \"Come here and take out one for yourself.\" And as the boy was stooping over the open chest, crash went the lid down, so that his head flew off among the red apples. But then the woman felt great terror, and wondered how she could escape the blame. And she went to the chest of drawers in her bedroom and took a white handkerchief out of the nearest drawer, and fitting the head to the neck, she bound them with the handkerchief, so that nothing should be seen, and set him on a chair before the door with the apple in his hand.\n\nThen came little Marjory into the kitchen to her mother, who was standing before the fire stirring a pot of hot water. \"Mother,\" said Marjory, \"my brother is sitting before the door and he has an apple in his hand, and looks very pale; I asked him to give me the apple, but he did not answer me; it seems very strange.\" - \"Go again to him,\" said the mother, \"and if he will not answer you, give him a box on the ear.\" So Marjory went again and said, \"Brother, give me the apple.\" But as he took no notice, she gave him a box on the ear, and his head fell off, at which she was greatly terrified, and began to cry and scream, and ran to her mother, and said, \"O mother.1 I have knocked my brother\'s head off!\" and cried and screamed, and would not cease. \"O Marjory!\" said her mother, \"what have you done? but keep quiet, that no one may see there is anything the matter; it can\'t be helped now; we will put him out of the way safely.\"\n\nWhen the father came home and sat down to table, he said, \"Where is my son?\" But the mother was filling a great dish full of black broth, and Marjory was crying bitterly, for she could not refrain. Then the father said again, \"Where is my son?\" - \"Oh,\" said the mother, \"he is gone into the country to his great-uncle\'s to stay for a little while.\" - \"What should he go for?\" said the father, \"and without bidding me good-bye, too!\" - \"Oh, he wanted to go so much, and he asked me to let him stay there six weeks; he will be well taken care of.\" - \"Dear me,\" said the father, \"I am quite sad about it; it was not right of him to go without bidding me good-bye.\" With that he began to eat, saying, \"Marjory, what are you crying for? Your brother will come back some time.\" After a while he said, \"Well, wife, the food is very good; give me some more.\" And the more he ate the more he wanted, until he had eaten it all up, and be threw the bones under the table. Then Marjory went to her chest of drawers, and took one of her best handkerchiefs from the bottom drawer, and picked up all the bones from under the table and tied them up in her handkerchief, and went out at the door crying bitterly. She laid them in the green grass under the almond tree, and immediately her heart grew light again, and she wept no more. Then the almond tree began to wave to and fro, and the boughs drew together and then parted, just like a clapping of hands for joy; then a cloud rose from the tree, and in the midst of the cloud there burned a fire, and out of the fire a beautiful bird arose, and, singing most sweetly, soared high into the air; and when he had flown away, the almond tree remained as it was before, but the handkerchief full of bones was gone. Marjory felt quite glad and light-hearted, just as if her brother were still alive. So she went back merrily into the house and had her dinner. The bird, when it flew away, perched on the roof of a goldsmith\'s house, and began to sing,\n\n\'\'It was my mother who murdered me;\nIt was my father who ate of me;\nIt was my sister Marjory\nWho all my bones in pieces found;\nhem in a handkerchief she bound,\nAnd laid them under the almond tree.\nKywitt, kywitt, kywitt, I cry,\nOh what a beautiful bird am I!\"\n\nThe goldsmith was sitting in his shop making a golden chain, and when he heard the bird, who was sitting on his roof and singing, he started up to go and look, and as he passed over his threshold he lost one of his slippers; and he went into the middle of the street with a slipper on one foot and-only a sock on the other; with his apron on, and the gold chain in one hand and the pincers in the other; and so he stood in the sunshine looking up at the bird. \"Bird,\" said he, \"how beautifully you sing; do sing that piece over again.\" - \"No,\" said the bird, \"I do not sing for nothing twice; if you will give me that gold chain I will sing again.\" - \"Very well,\" said the goldsmith, \"here is the gold chain; now do as you said.\" Down came the bird and took the gold chain in his right claw, perched in front of the goldsmith, and sang,\n\n\"It was my mother who murdered me;\nIt was my father who ate of me;\nIt was my sister Marjory\nWho all my bones in pieces found;\nThem in a handkerchief she bound,\nAnd laid them under the almond tree.\nKywitt, kywitt, kywitt, I cry,\nOh what a beautiful bird am I!\"\n\nThen the bird flew to a shoemaker\'s, and perched on his roof, and sang,\n\n\"It was my mother who murdered me;\nIt was my father who ate of me;\nIt was my sister Marjory\nWho all my bones in pieces found;\nThem in a handkerchief she bound,\nAnd laid them under the almond tree.\nKywitt, kywitt, kywitt, I cry,\nOh what a beautiful bird am I!\"\n\nWhen the shoemaker heard, he ran out of his door in his shirt sleeves and looked up at the roof of his house, holding his hand to shade his eyes from the sun. \"Bird,\" said he, \"how beautifully you sing!\" Then he called in at his door, \"Wife, come out directly; here is a bird singing beautifully; only listen.\" Then he called his daughter, all his children, and acquaintance, both young men and maidens, and they came up the street and gazed on the bird, and saw how beautiful it was with red and green feathers, and round its throat was as it were gold, and its eyes twinkled in its head like stars. \"Bird,\" said the shoemaker, \"do sing that piece over again.\" - \"No,\" said the bird, \"I may not sing for nothing twice; you must give me something.\" - \"Wife,\" said the man, \"go into the shop; on the top shelf stands a pair of red shoes; bring them here.\" So the wife went and brought the shoes. \"Now bird,\" said the man, \"sing us that piece again.\" And the bird came down and took the shoes in his left claw, and flew up again to the roof, and sang,\n\n\"It was my mother who murdered me;\nIt was my father who ate of me;\nIt was my sister Marjory\nWho all my bones in pieces found;\nhem in a handkerchief she bound,\nAnd laid them under the almond tree.\nKywitt, kywitt, kywitt, I ciy,\nOh what a beautiful bird am I!\"\n\nAnd when he had finished he flew away, with the chain in his right claw and the shoes in his left claw, and he flew till he reached a mill, and the mill went \"clip-clap, clip-clap, clip-clap.\" And in the mill sat twenty millers-men hewing a millstone- \"hick-hack, hick-hack, hick-hack,\" while the mill was going \"clip-clap, clip-clap, clip-clap.\" And the bird perched on a linden tree that stood in front of the mill, and sang, \"It was my mother who murdered me; \" Here one of the men looked up. \"It was my father who ate of me;\" Then two more looked up and listened. \"It was my sister Marjory \" Here four more looked up. \"Who all my bones in pieces found; Them in a handkerchief she bound,\" Now there were only eight left hewing. \"And laid them under the almond tree.\" Now only five. \"Kywitt, kywitt, kywitt, I cry,\" Now only one. \"Oh what a beautiful bird am I!\" At length the last one left off, and he only heard the end. \"Bird,\" said he, \"how beautifully you sing; let me hear it all; sing that again!\" - \"No,\" said the bird, \"I may not sing it twice for nothing; if you will give me the millstone I will sing it again.\" - \"Indeed,\" said the man, \"if it belonged to me alone you should have it.\" - \"All right,\" said the others, \"if he sings again he shall have it.\" Then the bird came down, and all the twenty millers heaved up the stone with poles - \"yo! heave-ho! yo! heave-ho!\" and the bird stuck his head through the hole in the middle, and with the millstone round his neck he flew up to the tree and sang,\n\n\"It was my mother who murdered me;\nIt was my father who ate of me;\nIt was my sister Marjory\nWho all my bones in pieces found;\nThem in a handkerchief she bound,\nAnd laid them under the almond tree.\nKywitt, kywitt, kywitt, I cry,\nOh what a beautiful bird am I!\"\n\nAnd when he had finished, he spread his wings,, having in the right claw the chain, and in the left claw the shoes, and round his neck the millstone, and he flew away to his father\'s house.\n\nIn the parlour sat the father, the mother, and Marjory at the table; the father said, \"How light-hearted and cheerful I feel.\" - \"Nay,\" said the mother, \"I feel very low, just as if a great storm were coming.\" But Marjory sat weeping; and the bird came flying, and perched on the roof \"Oh,\" said the father, \"I feel so joyful, and the sun is shining so bright; it is as if I were going to meet with an old friend.\" - \"Nay,\" said the wife, \"I am terrified, my teeth chatter, and there is fire in my veins,\" and she tore open her dress to get air; and Marjory sat in a corner and wept, with her plate before her, until it was quite full of tears. Then the bird perched on the almond tree, and sang, \'\' It was my mother who murdered me; \" And the mother stopped her ears and hid her eyes, and would neither see nor hear; nevertheless, the noise of a fearful storm was in her ears, and in her eyes a quivering and burning as of lightning. \"It was my father who ate of me;\'\' \"O mother!\" said the-father, \"there is a beautiful bird singing so finely, and the sun shines, and everything smells as sweet as cinnamon. \'\'It was my sister Marjory \" Marjory hid her face in her lap and wept, and the father said, \"I must go out to see the bird.\" - \"Oh do not go!\" said the wife, \"I feel as if the house were on fire.\" But the man went out and looked at the bird. \"Who all my bones in pieces found; Them in a handkerchief she bound, And laid them under the almond tree. Kywitt, kywitt, kywitt, I cry, Oh what a beautiful bird am I!\"\n\nWith that the bird let fall the gold chain upon his father\'s neck, and it fitted him exactly. So he went indoors and said, \"Look what a beautiful chain the bird has given me.\" Then his wife was so terrified that she fell all along on the floor, and her cap came off. Then the bird began again to sing, \"It was my mother who murdered me;\" - \"Oh,\" groaned the mother, \"that I were a thousand fathoms under ground, so as not to be obliged to hear it.\" - \"It was my father who ate of me;\" Then the woman lay as if she were dead. \"It was my sister Marjory \" - \"Oh,\" said Marjory, \"I will go out, too, and see if the bird will give me anything.\" And so she went. \"Who all my bones in pieces found; Them in a handkerchief she bound,\" Then he threw the shoes down to her. \"And laid them under the almond tree. Kywitt, kywitt, kywitt, I cry, Oh what a beautiful bird am I!\"\n\nAnd poor Marjory all at once felt happy and joyful, and put on her red shoes, and danced and jumped for joy. \"Oh dear,\" said she, \"I felt so sad before I went outside, and now my heart is so light! He is a charming bird to have given me a pair of red shoes.\" But the mother\'s hair stood on end, and looked like flame, and she said, \"Even if the world is coming to an end, I must go out for a little relief.\" Just as she came outside the door, crash went the millstone on her head, and crushed her flat. The father and daughter rushed out, and saw smoke and flames of fire rise up; but when that had gone by, there stood the little brother; and he took his father and Marjory by the hand, and they felt very happy and content, and went indoors, and sat to the table, and had their dinner.\n</string>
    <string name="story290text">There was once a young fellow who enlisted as a soldier, conducted himself bravely, and was always the foremost when it rained bullets. So long as the war lasted, all went well, but when peace was made, he received his dismissal, and the captain said he might go where he liked. His parents were dead, and he had no longer a home, so he went to his brothers and begged them to take him in, and keep him until war broke out again. The brothers, however, were hard-hearted and said, \"What can we do with thee? thou art of no use to us; go and make a living for thyself.\" The soldier had nothing left but his gun; he took that on his shoulder, and went forth into the world. He came to a wide heath, on which nothing was to be seen but a circle of trees; under these he sat sorrowfully down, and began to think over his fate. \"I have no money,\" thought he, \"I have learnt no trade but that of fighting, and now that they have made peace they don\'t want me any longer; so I see beforehand that I shall have to starve.\" All at once he heard a rustling, and when he looked round, a strange man stood before him, who wore a green coat and looked right stately, but had a hideous cloven foot. \"I know already what thou art in need of,\" said the man; \"gold and possessions shall thou have, as much as thou canst make away with do what thou wilt, but first I must know if thou art fearless, that I may not bestow my money in vain.\" - \"A soldier and fear - how can those two things go together?\" he answered; \"thou canst put me to the proof.\" - \"Very well, then,\" answered the man, \"look behind thee.\" The soldier turned round, and saw a large bear, which came growling towards him. \"Oho!\" cried the soldier, \"I will tickle thy nose for thee, so that thou shalt soon lose thy fancy for growling,\" and he aimed at the bear and shot it through the muzzle; it fell down and never stirred again. \"I see quite well,\" said the stranger, \"that thou art not wanting in courage, but there is still another condition which thou wilt have to fulfil.\" - \"If it does not endanger my salvation,\" replied the soldier, who knew very well who was standing by him. \"If it does, I\'ll have nothing to do with it.\" - \"Thou wilt look to that for thyself,\" answered Greencoat; \"thou shalt for the next seven years neither wash thyself, nor comb thy beard, nor thy hair, nor cut thy nails, nor say one paternoster. I will give thee a coat and a cloak, which during this time thou must wear. If thou diest during these seven years, thou art mine; if thou remainest alive, thou art free, and rich to boot, for all the rest of thy life.\" The soldier thought of the great extremity in which he now found himself, and as he so often had gone to meet death, he resolved to risk it now also, and agreed to the terms. The Devil took off his green coat, gave it to the soldier, and said, \"If thou hast this coat on thy back and puttest thy hand into the pocket, thou wilt always find it full of money.\" Then he pulled the skin off the bear and said, \"This shall be thy cloak, and thy bed also, for thereon shalt thou sleep, and in no other bed shalt thou lie, and because of this apparel shalt thou be called Bearskin.\" After this the Devil vanished.\n\nThe soldier put the coat on, felt at once in the pocket, and found that the thing was really true. Then he put on the bearskin and went forth into the world, and enjoyed himself, refraining from nothing that did him good and his money harm. During the first year his appearance was passable, but during the second he began to look like a monster. His hair covered nearly the whole of his face, his beard was like a piece of coarse felt, his fingers had claws, and his face was so covered with dirt that if cress had been sown on it, it would have come up. Whosoever saw him, ran away, but as he everywhere gave the poor money to pray that he might not die during the seven years, and as he paid well for everything he still always found shelter. In the fourth year, he entered an inn where the landlord would not receive him, and would not even let him have a place in the stable, because he was afraid the horses would be scared. But as Bearskin thrust his hand into his pocket and pulled out a handful of ducats, the host let himself be persuaded and gave him a room in an outhouse. Bearskin was, however, obliged to promise not to let himself be seen, lest the inn should get a bad name.\n\nAs Bearskin was sitting alone in the evening, and wishing from the bottom of his heart that the seven years were over, he heard a loud lamenting in a neighboring room. He had a compassionate heart, so he opened the door, and saw an old man weeping bitterly, and wringing his hands. Bearskin went nearer, but the man sprang to his feet and tried to escape from him. At last when the man perceived that Bearskin\'s voice was human he let himself be prevailed on, and by kind words bearskin succeeded so far that the old man revealed the cause of his grief. His property had dwindled away by degrees, he and his daughters would have to starve, and he was so poor that he could not pay the innkeeper, and was to be put in prison. \"If that is your only trouble,\" said Bearskin, \"I have plenty of money.\" He caused the innkeeper to be brought thither, paid him and put a purse full of gold into the poor old man\'s pocket besides.\n\nWhen the old man saw himself set free from all his troubles he did not know how to be grateful enough. \"Come with me,\" said he to Bearskin; \"my daughters are all miracles of beauty, choose one of them for thyself as a wife. When she hears what thou hast done for me, she will not refuse thee. Thou dost in truth look a little strange, but she will soon put thee to rights again.\" This pleased Bearskin well, and he went. When the eldest saw him she was so terribly alarmed at his face that she screamed and ran away. The second stood still and looked at him from head to foot, but then she said, \"How can I accept a husband who no longer has a human form? The shaven bear that once was here and passed itself off for a man pleased me far better, for at any rate it wore a hussar\'s dress and white gloves. If it were nothing but ugliness, I might get used to that.\" The youngest, however, said, \"Dear father, that must be a good man to have helped you out of your trouble, so if you have promised him a bride for doing it, your promise must be kept.\" It was a pity that Bearskin\'s face was covered with dirt and with hair, for if not they might have seen how delighted he was when he heard these words. He took a ring from his finger, broke it in two, and gave her one half, the other he kept for himself. He wrote his name, however, on her half, and hers on his, and begged her to keep her piece carefully, and then he took his leave and said, \"I must still wander about for three years, and if I do not return then, thou art free, for I shall be dead. But pray to God to preserve my life.\"\n\nThe poor betrothed bride dressed herself entirely in black, and when she thought of her future bridegroom, tears came into her eyes. Nothing but contempt and mockery fell to her lot from her sisters. \"Take care,\" said the eldest, \"if thou givest him thy hand, he will strike his claws into it.\" - \"Beware!\" said the second. \"Bears like sweet things, and if he takes a fancy to thee, he will eat thee up.\" - \"Thou must always do as he likes,\" began the elder again, \"or else he will growl.\" And the second continued, \"But the wedding will be a merry one, for bears dance well.\" The bride was silent, and did not let them vex her. Bearskin, however, travelled about the world from one place to another, did good where he was able, and gave generously to the poor that they might pray for him.\n\nAt length, as the last day of the seven years dawned, he went once more out on to the heath, and seated himself beneath the circle of trees. It was not long before the wind whistled, and the Devil stood before him and looked angrily at him; then he threw Bearskin his old coat, and asked for his own green one back. \"We have not got so far as that yet,\" answered Bearskin, \"thou must first make me clean.\" Whether the Devil liked it or not, he was forced to fetch water, and wash Bearskin, comb his hair, and cut his nails. After this, he looked like a brave soldier, and was much handsomer than he had ever been before.\n\nWhen the Devil had gone away, Bearskin was quite lighthearted. He went into the town, put on a magnificent velvet coat, seated himself in a carriage drawn by four white horses, and drove to his bride\'s house. No one recognized him, the father took him for a distinguished general, and led him into the room where his daughters were sitting. He was forced to place himself between the two eldest, they helped him to wine, gave him the best pieces of meat, and thought that in all the world they had never seen a handsomer man. The bride, however, sat opposite to him in her black dress, and never raised her eyes, nor spoke a word. When at length he asked the father if he would give him one of his daughters to wife, the two eldest jumped up, ran into their bedrooms to put on splendid dresses, for each of them fancied she was the chosen one. The stranger, as soon as he was alone with his bride, brought out his half of the ring, and threw it in a glass of wine which he reached across the table to her. She took the wine, but when she had drunk it, and found the half ring lying at the bottom, her heart began to beat. She got the other half, which she wore on a ribbon round her neck, joined them, and saw that the two pieces fitted exactly together. Then said he, \"I am thy betrothed bridegroom, whom thou sawest as Bearskin, but through God\'s grace I have again received my human form, and have once more become clean.\" He went up to her, embraced her, and gave her a kiss. In the meantime the two sisters came back in full dress, and when they saw that the handsome man had fallen to the share of the youngest, and heard that he was Bearskin, they ran out full of anger and rage. One of them drowned herself in the well, the other hanged herself on a tree. In the evening, some one knocked at the door, and when the bridegroom opened it, it was the Devil in his green coat, who said, \"Seest thou, I have now got two souls in the place of thy one!\"</string>
    <string name="story291text">\"Where do you like best to feed your flocks?\" said a man to an old cow-herd. \"Here, sir, where the grass is neither too rich nor too poor, or else it is no use.\" - \"Why not?\" asked the man. \"Do you hear that melancholy cry from the meadow there?\" answered the shepherd, \"that is the bittern; he was once a shepherd, and so was the hoopoe also,—I will tell you the story. The bittern pastured his flocks on rich green meadows where flowers grew in abundance, so his cows became wild and unmanageable. The hoopoe drove his cattle on to high barren hills, where the wind plays with the sand, and his cows became thin, and got no strength. When it was evening, and the shepherds wanted to drive their cows homewards, the bittern could not get his together again; they were too high-spirited, and ran away from him. He called, \"Come, cows, come,\" but it was of no use; they took no notice of his calling. The hoopoe, however, could not even get his cows up on their legs, so faint and weak had they become. \"Up, up, up,\" screamed he, but it was in vain, they remained lying on the sand. That is the way when one has no moderation. And to this day, though they have no flocks now to watch, the bittern cries, \"Come, cows, come,\" and the hoopoe, \"Up, up, up.\"</string>
    <string name="story292text">There was once on a time a soldier who for many years had served the King faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer because of the many wounds which he had received. The King said to him, \"Thou mayst return to thy home, I need thee no longer, and thou wilt not receive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me service for them.\" Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living, went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the evening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light, which he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. \"Do give me one night\'s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,\" said he to her, \"or I shall starve.\" - \"Oho!\" she answered, \"who gives anything to a run-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you will do what I wish.\" - \"What do you wish?\" said the soldier. \"That you should dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.\" The soldier consented, and next day labored with all his strength, but could not finish it by the evening. \"I see well enough,\" said the witch, \"that you can do no more to-day, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for which you must to-morrow chop me a load of wood, and make it small.\" The soldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch proposed that he should stay one night more. \"To-morrow, you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an old dry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes out, and you shall bring it up again for me.\" Next day the old woman took him to the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from him. \"No,\" said he, perceiving her evil intention, \"I will not give thee the light until I am standing with both feet upon the ground.\" The witch fell into a passion, let him down again into the well, and went away.\nThe poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue light went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well that he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still half full. \"This shall be my last pleasure,\" thought he, pulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When the smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood before him, and said, \"Lord, what are thy commands?\" - \"What commands have I to give thee?\" replied the soldier, quite astonished. \"I must do everything thou biddest me,\" said the little man. \"Good,\" said the soldier; \"then in the first place help me out of this well.\" The little man took him by the hand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget to take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above, he said to the little man, \"Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before the judge.\" In a short time she, with frightful cries, came riding by, as swift as the wind on a wild tom-cat, nor was it long after that before the little man re-appeared. \"It is all done,\" said he, \"and the witch is already hanging on the gallows. What further commands has my lord?\" inquired the dwarf. \"At this moment, none,\" answered the soldier; \"Thou canst return home, only be at hand immediately, if I summon thee.\" - \"Nothing more is needed than that thou shouldst light thy pipe at the blue light, and I will appear before thee at once.\" Thereupon he vanished from his sight.\n\nThe soldier returned to the town from which he had come. He went to the best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord furnish him a room as handsomely as possible. When it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black mannikin and said, \"I have served the King faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.\" - \"What am I to do?\" asked the little man. \"Late at night, when the King\'s daughter is in bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant\'s work for me.\" The mannikin said, \"That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.\" When twelve o\'clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the mannikin carried in the princess. \"Aha! art thou there?\" cried the soldier, \"get to thy work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.\" When she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he stretched out his feet and said, \"Pull off my boots for me,\" and then he threw them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean and brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without opposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock crowed, the mannikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her in her bed.\n\nNext morning when the princess arose, she went to her father, and told him that she had had a very strange dream. \"I was carried through the streets with the rapidity of lightning,\" said she, \"and taken into a soldier\'s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his room, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a dream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.\" - \"The dream may have been true,\" said the King, \"I will give thee a piece of advice. Fill thy pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in it, and then if thou art carried away again, they will fall out and leave a track in the streets.\" But unseen by the King, the mannikin was standing beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when the sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the crafty mannikin had just before scattered peas in every street there was. And again the princess was compelled to do servant\'s work until cock-crow.\n\nNext morning the King sent his people out to seek the track, but it was all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up peas, and saying, \"It must have rained peas, last night.\" - \"We must think of something else,\" said the King; \"keep thy shoes on when thou goest to bed, and before thou comest back from the place where thou art taken, hide one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.\" The black mannikin heard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to bring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no expedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found in the soldier\'s house it would go badly with him. \"Do what I bid thee,\" replied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged to work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under the bed.\n\nNext morning the King had the entire town searched for his daughter\'s shoe. It was found at the soldier\'s, and the soldier himself, who at the entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back, and thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in his pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of his dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to him, \"Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in the inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.\" His comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black mannikin. \"Have no fear,\" said the latter to his master. \"Go wheresoever they take you, and let them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.\" Next day the soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge condemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last favor of the King. \"What is it?\" asked the King. \"That I may smoke one more pipe on my way.\" - \"Thou mayst smoke three,\" answered the King, \"but do not imagine that I will spare thy life.\" Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended, the mannikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said, \"What does my lord command?\" - \"Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his constable, and spare not the King who has treated me so ill.\" Then the mannikin fell on them like lightning, darting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. The King was terrified; he threw himself on the soldier\'s mercy, and merely to be allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and the princess to wife.</string>
    <string name="story293text">A soldier who is afraid of nothing, troubles himself about nothing. One of this kind had received his discharge, and as he had learnt no trade and could earn nothing, he travelled about and begged alms of kind people. He had an old waterproof on his back, and a pair of riding-boots of buffalo-leather which were still left to him. One day he was walking he knew not where, straight out into the open country, and at length came to a forest. He did not know where he was, but saw sitting on the trunk of a tree, which had been cut down, a man who was well dressed and wore a green shooting-coat. The soldier shook hands with him, sat down on the grass by his side, and stretched out his legs. \"I see thou hast good boots on, which are well blacked,\" said he to the huntsman; \"but if thou hadst to travel about as I have, they would not last long. Look at mine, they are of buffalo-leather, and have been worn for a long time, but in them I can go through thick and thin.\" After a while the soldier got up and said, \"I can stay no longer, hunger drives me onwards; but, Brother Bright-boots, where does this road lead to?\" - \"I don\'t know that myself,\" answered the huntsman, \"I have lost my way in the forest.\" - \"Then thou art in the same plight as I,\" said the soldier; \"birds of a feather flock together, let us remain together, and seek our way.\" The huntsman smiled a little, and they walked on further and further, until night fell. \"We do not get out of the forest,\" said the soldier, \"but there in the distance I see a light shining, which will help us to something to eat.\" They found a stone house, knocked at the door, and an old woman opened it. \"We are looking for quarters for the night,\" said the soldier, \"and some lining for our stomachs, for mine is as empty as an old knapsack.\" - \"You cannot stay here,\" answered the old woman; \"this is a robber\'s house, and you would do wisely to get away before they come home, or you will be lost.\" - \"It won\'t be so bad as that,\" answered the soldier, \"I have not had a mouthful for two days, and whether I am murdered here or die of hunger in the forest is all the same to me. I shall go in.\" The huntsman would not follow, but the soldier drew him in with him by the sleeve. \"Come, my dear brother, we shall not come to an end so quickly as that!\" The old woman had pity on them and said, \"Creep in here behind the stove, and if they leave anything, I will give it to you on the sly when they are asleep.\" Scarcely were they in the corner before twelve robbers came bursting in, seated themselves at the table which was already laid, and vehemently demanded some food. The old woman brought in some great dishes of roast meat, and the robbers enjoyed that thoroughly. When the smell of the food ascended the nostrils of the soldier, he said to the huntsman, \"I cannot hold out any longer, I shall seat myself at the table, and eat with them.\" thou wilt bring us to destruction,\" said the huntsman, and held him back by the arm. But the soldier began to cough loudly. When the robbers heard that, they threw away their knives and forks, leapt up, and discovered the two who were behind the stove. \"Aha, gentlemen, are you in the corner?\" cried they, \"What are you doing here? Have you been sent as spies? Wait a while, and you shall learn how to fly on a dry bough.\" - \"But do be civil,\" said the soldier, \"I am hungry, give me something to eat, and then you can do what you like with me.\" The robbers were astonished, and the captain said, \"I see that thou hast no fear; well, thou shalt have some food, but after that thou must die.\" - \"We shall see,\" said the soldier, and seated himself at the table, and began to cut away valiantly at the roast meat. \"Brother Brightboots, come and eat,\" cried he to the huntsman; \"thou must be as hungry as I am, and cannot have better roast meat at home,\" but the huntsman would not eat. The robbers looked at the soldier in astonishment, and said, \"The rascal uses no ceremony.\" After a while he said, \"I have had enough food, now get me something good to drink.\" The captain was in the mood to humour him in this also, and called to the old woman, \"Bring a bottle out of the cellar, and mind it be of the best.\" The soldier drew the cork out with a loud noise, and then went with the bottle to the huntsman and said, \"Pay attention, brother, and thou shalt see something that will surprise thee; I am now going to drink the health of the whole clan.\" Then he brandished the bottle over the heads of the robbers, and cried, \"Long life to you all, but with your mouths open and your right hands lifted up,\" and then he drank a hearty draught. Scarcely were the words said than they all sat motionless as if made of stone, and their mouths were open and their right hands stretched up in the air. The huntsman said to the soldier, \"I see that thou art acquainted with tricks of another kind, but now come and let us go home.\" - \"Oho, my dear brother, but that would be marching away far too soon; we have conquered the enemy, and must first take the booty. Those men there are sitting fast, and are opening their mouths with astonishment, but they will not be allowed to move until I permit them. Come, eat and drink.\" The old woman had to bring another bottle of the best wine, and the soldier would not stir until he had eaten enough to last for three days. At last when day came, he said, \"Now it is time to strike our tents, and that our march may be a short one, the old woman shall show us the nearest way to the town.\" When they had arrived there, he went to his old comrades, and said, \"Out in the forest I have found a nest full of gallows\' birds, come with me and we will take it.\" The soldier led them, and said to the huntsman, \"Thou must go back again with me to see how they shake when we seize them by the feet.\" He placed the men round about the robbers, and then he took the bottle, drank a mouthful, brandished it above them, and cried, \"Live again.\" Instantly they all regained the power of movement, but were thrown down and bound hand and foot with cords. Then the soldier ordered them to be thrown into a cart as if they had been so many sacks, and said, \"Now drive them straight to prison.\" The huntsman, however, took one of the men aside and gave him another commission besides. \"Brother Bright-boots,\" said the soldier, \"we have safely routed the enemy and been well fed, now we will quietly walk behind them as if we were stragglers!\" When they approached the town, the soldier saw a crowd of people pouring through the gate of the town who were raising loud cries of joy, and waving green boughs in the air. Then he saw that the entire body-guard was coming up. \"What can this mean?\" said he to the huntsman. \"Dost thou not know?\" he replied, \"that the King has for a long time been absent from his kingdom, and that to-day he is returning, and every one is going to meet him.\" - \"But where is the King?\" said the soldier, \"I do not see him.\" - \"Here he is,\" answered the huntsman, \"I am the King, and have announced my arrival.\" Then he opened his hunting-coat, and his royal garments were visible. The soldier was alarmed, and fell on his knees and begged him to forgive him for having in his ignorance treated him as an equal, and spoken to him by such a name. But the King shook hands with him, and said, \"Thou art a brave soldier, and hast saved my life. Thou shalt never again be in want, I will take care of thee. And if ever thou wouldst like to eat a piece of roast meat, as good as that in the robber\'s house, come to the royal kitchen. But if thou wouldst drink a health, thou must first ask my permission.\"</string>
    <string name="story294text">There was once an ass whose master had made him carry sacks to the mill for many a long year, but whose strength began at last to fail, so that each day as it came found him less capable of work. Then his master began to think of turning him out, but the ass, guessing that something was in the wind that boded him no good, ran away, taking the road to Bremen; for there he thought he might get an engagement as town musician. When he had gone a little way he found a hound lying by the side of the road panting, as if he had run a long way. \"Now, Holdfast, what are you so out of breath about?\" said the ass. \"Oh dear!\" said the dog, \"now I am old, I get weaker every day, and can do no good in the hunt, so, as my master was going to have me killed, I have made my escape; but now, how am I to gain a living?\" - \"I will tell you what,\" said the ass, \"I am going to Bremen to become town musician. You may as well go with me, and take up music too. I can play the lute, and you can beat the drum.\" And the dog consented, and they walked on together. It was not long before they came to a cat sitting in the road, looking as dismal as three wet days. \"Now then, what is the matter with you, old shaver?\" said the ass. \"I should like to know who would be cheerful when his neck is in danger,\" answered the cat. \"Now that I am old my teeth are getting blunt, and I would rather sit by the oven and purr than run about after mice, and my mistress wanted to drown me; so I took myself off; but good advice is scarce, and I do not know what is to become of me.\" - \"Go with us to Bremen,\" said the ass, \"and become town musician. You understand serenading.\" The cat thought well of the idea, and went with them accordingly. After that the three travellers passed by a yard, and a cock was perched on the gate crowing with all his might. \"Your cries are enough to pierce bone and marrow,\" said the ass; \"what is the matter?\" - \"I have foretold good weather for Lady-day, so that all the shirts may be washed and dried; and now on Sunday morning company is coming, and the mistress has told the cook that I must be made into soup, and this evening my neck is to be wrung, so that I am crowing with all my might while I can.\" - \"You had much better go with us, Chanticleer,\" said the ass. \"We are going to Bremen. At any rate that will be better than dying. You have a powerful voice, and when we are all performing together it will have a very good effect.\" So the cock consented, and they went on all four together.\n\nBut Bremen was too far off to be reached in one day, and towards evening they came to a wood, where they determined to pass the night. The ass and the dog lay down under a large tree; the cat got up among the branches, and the cock flew up to the top, as that was the safest place for him. Before he went to sleep he looked all round him to the four points of the compass, and perceived in the distance a little light shining, and he called out to his companions that there must be a house not far off, as he could see a light, so the ass said, \"We had better get up and go there, for these are uncomfortable quarters.\" The dog began to fancy a few bones, not quite bare, would do him good. And they all set off in the direction of the light, and it grew larger and brighter, until at last it led them to a robber\'s house, all lighted up. The ass. being the biggest, went up to the window, and looked in. \"Well, what do you see?\" asked the dog. \"What do I see?\" answered the ass; \"here is a table set out with splendid eatables and drinkables, and robbers sitting at it and making themselves very comfortable.\" - \"That would just suit us,\" said the cock. \"Yes, indeed, I wish we were there,\" said the ass. Then they consulted together how it should be managed so as to get the robbers out of the house, and at last they hit on a plan. The ass was to place his forefeet on the window-sill, the dog was to get on the ass\'s back, the cat on the top of the dog, and lastly the cock was to fly up and perch on the cat\'s head. When that was done, at a given signal they all began to perform their music. The ass brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock crowed; then they burst through into the room, breaking all the panes of glass. The robbers fled at the dreadful sound; they thought it was some goblin, and fled to the wood in the utmost terror. Then the four companions sat down to table, made free with the remains of the meal, and feasted as if they had been hungry for a month.\n\nAnd when they had finished they put out the lights, and each sought out a sleeping-place to suit his nature and habits. The ass laid himself down outside on the dunghill, the dog behind the door, the cat on the hearth by the warm ashes, and the cock settled himself in the cockloft, and as they were all tired with their long journey they soon fell fast asleep. When midnight drew near, and the robbers from afar saw that no light was burning, and that everything appeared quiet, their captain said to them that he thought that they had run away without reason, telling one of them to go and reconnoitre. So one of them went, and found everything quite quiet; he went into the kitchen to strike a light, and taking the glowing fiery eyes of the cat for burning coals, he held a match to them in order to kindle it. But the cat, not seeing the joke, flew into his face, spitting and scratching. Then he cried out in terror, and ran to get out at the back door, but the dog, who was lying there, ran at him and bit his leg; and as he was rushing through the yard by the dunghill the ass struck out and gave him a great kick with his hind foot; and the cock, who had been wakened with the noise, and felt quite brisk, cried out, \"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\" Then the robber got back as well as he could to his captain, and said, \"Oh dear! in that house there is a gruesome witch, and I felt her breath and her long nails in my face; and by the door there stands a man who stabbed me in the leg with a knife; and in the yard there lies a black spectre, who beat me with his wooden club; and above, upon the roof, there sits the justice, who cried, \'Bring that rogue here!\' And so I ran away from the place as fast as I could.\" From that time forward the robbers never ventured to that house, and the four Bremen town musicians found themselves so well off where they were, that there they stayed. And the person who last related this tale is still living, as you see.</string>
    <string name="story295text">There was once a young shepherd who wished much to marry, and was acquainted with three sisters who were all equally pretty, so that it was difficult to him to make a choice, and he could not decide to give the preference to any one of them. Then he asked his mother for advice, and she said, \"Invite all three, and set some cheese before them, and watch how they eat it.\" The youth did so; the first, however, swallowed the cheese with the rind on; the second hastily cut the rind off the cheese, but she cut it so quickly that she left much good cheese with it, and threw that away also; the third peeled the rind off carefully, and cut neither too much nor too little. The shepherd told all this to his mother, who said, \"Take the third for thy wife.\" This he did, and lived contentedly and happily with her.</string>
    <string name="story297text">There was one on a time a great war, and when it came to an end, many soldiers were discharged. Then Brother Lustig also received his dismissal, and besides that, nothing but a small loaf of contract-bread, and four kreuzers in money, with which he departed. St. Peter had, however, placed himself in his way in the shape of a poor beggar, and when Brother Lustig came up, he begged alms of him. Brother Lustig replied, \"Dear beggar-man, what am I to give you? I have been a soldier, and have received my dismissal, and have nothing but this little loaf of contract-bread, and four kreuzers of money; when that is gone, I shall have to beg as well as you. Still I will give you something.\" Thereupon he divided the loaf into four parts, and gave the apostle one of them, and a kreuzer likewise. St. Peter thanked him, went onwards, and threw himself again in the soldier\'s way as a beggar, but in another shape; and when he came up begged a gift of him as before. Brother Lustig spoke as he had done before, and again gave him a quarter of the loaf and one kreuzer. St. Peter thanked him, and went onwards, but for the third time placed himself in another shape as a beggar on the road, and spoke to Brother Lustig. Brother Lustig gave him also the third quarter of bread and the third kreuzer. St. Peter thanked him, and Brother Lustig went onwards, and had but a quarter of the loaf, and one kreuzer. With that he went into an inn, ate the bread, and ordered one kreuzer\'s worth of beer. When he had had it, he journeyed onwards, and then St. Peter, who had assumed the appearance of a discharged soldier, met and spoke to him thus: \"Good day, comrade, canst thou not give me a bit of bread, and a kreuzer to get a drink?\" - \"Where am I to procure it?\" answered Brother Lustig; \"I have been discharged, and I got nothing but a loaf of ammunition-bread and four kreuzers in money. I met three beggars on the road, and I gave each of them a quarter of my bread, and one kreuzer. The last quarter I ate in the inn, and had a drink with the last kreuzer. Now my pockets are empty, and if thou also hast nothing we can go a-begging together.\" - \"No,\" answered St. Peter, \"we need not quite do that. I know a little about medicine, and I will soon earn as much as I require by that.\" - \"Indeed,\" said Brother Lustig, \"I know nothing of that, so I must go and beg alone.\" - \"Just come with me,\" said St. Peter, \"and if I earn anything, thou shalt have half of it.\" - \"All right,\" said Brother Lustig, so they went away together.\nThen they came to a peasant\'s house inside which they heard loud lamentations and cries; so they went in, and there the husband was lying sick unto death, and very near his end, and his wife was crying and weeping quite loudly. \"Stop that howling and crying,\" said St. Peter, \"I will make the man well again,\" and he took a salve out of his pocket, and healed the sick man in a moment, so that he could get up, and was in perfect health. In great delight the man and his wife said, \"How can we reward you? What shall we give you?\" But St. Peter would take nothing, and the more the peasant folks offered him, the more he refused. Brother Lustig, however, nudged St. Peter, and said, \"Take something; sure enough we are in need of it.\" At length the woman brought a lamb and said to St. Peter that he really must take that, but he would not. Then Brother Lustig gave him a poke in the side, and said, \"Do take it, you stupid fool; we are in great want of it!\" Then St. Peter said at last, \"Well, I will take the lamb, but I won\'t carry it; if thou wilt insist on having it, thou must carry it.\" - \"That is nothing,\" said Brother Lustig. \"I will easily carry it,\" and took it on his shoulder. Then they departed and came to a wood, but Brother Lustig had begun to feel the lamb heavy, and he was hungry, so he said to St. Peter, \"Look, that\'s a good place, we might cook the lamb there, and eat it.\" - \"As you like,\" answered St. Peter, \"but I can\'t have anything to do with the cooking; if thou wilt cook, there is a kettle for thee, and in the meantime I will walk about a little until it is ready. Thou must, however, not begin to eat until I have come back, I will come at the right time.\" - \"Well, go, then,\" said Brother Lustig, \"I understand cookery, I will manage it.\" Then St. Peter went away, and Brother Lustig killed the lamb, lighted a fire, threw the meat into the kettle, and boiled it. The lamb was, however, quite ready, and the apostle Peter had not come back, so Brother Lustig took it out of the kettle, cut it up, and found the heart. \"That is said to be the best part,\" said he, and tasted it, but at last he ate it all up. At length St. Peter returned and said, \"Thou mayst eat the whole of the lamb thyself, I will only have the heart, give me that.\" Then Brother Lustig took a knife and fork, and pretended to look anxiously about amongst the lamb\'s flesh, but not to be able to find the heart, and at last he said abruptly, \"There is none here.\" - \"But where can it be?\" said the apostle. \"I don\'t know,\" replied Brother Lustig, \"but look, what fools we both are, to seek for the lamb\'s heart, and neither of us to remember that a lamb has no heart!\" - \"Oh,\" said St. Peter, \"that is something quite new! Every animal has a heart, why is a lamb to have none?\" - \"No, be assured, my brother,\" said Brother Lustig, \"that a lamb has no heart; just consider it seriously, and then you will see that it really has none.\" - \"Well, it is all right,\" said St. Peter, \"if there is no heart, then I want none of the lamb; thou mayst eat it alone.\" - \"What I can\'t eat now, I will carry away in my knapsack,\" said Brother Lustig, and he ate half the lamb, and put the rest in his knapsack.\n\nThey went farther, and then St. Peter caused a great stream of water to flow right across their path, and they were obliged to pass through it. Said St. Peter, \"Do thou go first.\" - \"No,\" answered Brother Lustig, \"thou must go first,\" and he thought, \"if the water is too deep I will stay behind.\" Then St. Peter strode through it, and the water just reached to his knee. So Brother Lustig began to go through also, but the water grew deeper and reached to his throat. Then he cried, \"Brother, help me!\" St. Peter said, \"Then wilt thou confess that thou hast eaten the lamb\'s heart?\" - \"No,\" said he, \"I have not eaten it.\" Then the water grew deeper still and rose to his mouth. \"Help me, brother,\" cried the soldier. St. Peter said, \"Then wilt thou confess that thou hast eaten the lamb\'s heart?\" - \"No,\" he replied, \"I have not eaten it.\" St. Peter, however, would not let him be drowned, but made the water sink and helped him through it.\n\nThen they journeyed onwards, and came to a kingdom where they heard that the King\'s daughter lay sick unto death. \"Hollo, brother!\" said the soldier to St. Peter, \"this is a chance for us; if we can heal her we shall be provided for, for life!\" But St. Peter was not half quick enough for him, \"Come, lift your legs, my dear brother,\" said he, \"that we may get there in time.\" But St. Peter walked slower and slower, though Brother Lustig did all he could to drive and push him on, and at last they heard that the princess was dead. \"Now we are done for!\" said Brother Lustig; \"that comes of thy sleepy way of walking!\" - \"Just be quiet,\" answered St. Peter, \"I can do more than cure sick people; I can bring dead ones to life again.\" - \"Well, if thou canst do that,\" said Brother Lustig, \"it\'s all right, but thou shouldst earn at least half the kingdom for us by that.\" Then they went to the royal palace, where every one was in great grief, but St. Peter told the King that he would restore his daughter to life. He was taken to her, and said, \"Bring me a kettle and some water,\" and when that was brought, he bade everyone go out, and allowed no one to remain with him but Brother Lustig. Then he cut off all the dead girl\'s limbs, and threw them in the water, lighted a fire beneath the kettle, and boiled them. And when the flesh had fallen away from the bones, he took out the beautiful white bones, and laid them on a table, and arranged them together in their natural order. When he had done that, he stepped forward and said three times, \"In the name of the holy Trinity, dead woman, arise.\" And at the third time, the princess arose, living, healthy and beautiful. Then the King was in the greatest joy, and said to St. Peter, \"Ask for thy reward; even if it were half my kingdom, I would give it thee.\" But St. Peter said, \"I want nothing for it.\" - \"Oh, thou tomfool!\" thought Brother Lustig to himself, and nudged his comrade\'s side, and said, \"Don\'t be so stupid! If thou hast no need of anything, I have.\" St. Peter, however, would have nothing, but as the King saw that the other would very much like to have something, he ordered his treasurer to fill Brother Lustig\'s knapsack with gold. Then they went on their way, and when they came to a forest, St. Peter said to Brother Lustig, \"Now, we will divide the gold.\" - \"Yes,\" he replied, \"we will.\" So St. Peter divided the gold, and divided it into three heaps. Brother Lustig thought to himself, \"What craze has he got in his head now? He is making three shares, and there are only two of us!\" But St. Peter said, \"I have divided it exactly; there is one share for me, one for thee, and one for him who ate the lamb\'s heart.\"\n\n\"Oh, I ate that!\" replied Brother Lustig, and hastily swept up the gold. \"You may trust what I say.\" - \"But how can that be true,\" said St. Peter, \"when a lamb has no heart?\" - \"Eh, what, brother, what can you be thinking of? Lambs have hearts like other animals, why should only they have none?\" - \"Well, so be it,\" said St. Peter, \"keep the gold to yourself, but I will stay with you no longer; I will go my way alone.\" - \"As you like, dear brother,\" answered Brother Lustig. \"Farewell.\"\n\nThen St. Peter went a different road, but Brother Lustig thought, \"It is a good thing that he has taken himself off, he is certainly a strange saint, after all.\" Then he had money enough, but did not know how to manage it, squandered it, gave it away, and when some time had gone by, once more had nothing. Then he arrived in a certain country where he heard that a King\'s daughter was dead. \"Oh, ho!\" thought he, \"that may be a good thing for me; I will bring her to life again, and see that I am paid as I ought to be.\" So he went to the King, and offered to raise the dead girl to life again. Now the King had heard that a discharged soldier was traveling about and bringing dead persons to life again, and thought that Brother Lustig was the man; but as he had no confidence in him, he consulted his councillors first, who said that he might give it a trial as his daughter was dead. Then Brother Lustig ordered water to be brought to him in a kettle, bade every one go out, cut the limbs off, threw them in the water and lighted a fire beneath, just as he had seen St. Peter do. The water began to boil, the flesh fell off, and then he took the bones out and laid them on the table, but he did not know the order in which to lay them, and placed them all wrong and in confusion. Then he stood before them and said, \"In the name of the most holy Trinity, dead maiden, I bid thee arise,\" and he said this thrice, but the bones did not stir. So he said it thrice more, but also in vain: \"Confounded girl that you are, get up!\" cried he, \"Get up, or it shall be worse for you!\" When he had said that, St. Peter suddenly appeared in his former shape as a discharged soldier; he entered by the window and said, \"Godless man, what art thou doing? How can the dead maiden arise, when thou hast thrown about her bones in such confusion?\" - \"Dear brother, I have done everything to the best of my ability,\" he answered. \"This once, I will help thee out of thy difficulty, but one thing I tell thee, and that is that if ever thou undertakest anything of the kind again, it will be the worse for thee, and also that thou must neither demand nor accept the smallest thing from the King for this!\" Thereupon St. Peter laid the bones in their right order, said to the maiden three times, \"In the name of the most holy Trinity, dead maiden, arise,\" and the King\'s daughter arose, healthy and beautiful as before. Then St. Peter went away again by the window, and Brother Lustig was rejoiced to find that all had passed off so well, but was very much vexed to think that after all he was not to take anything for it. \"I should just like to know,\" thought he, \"what fancy that fellow has got in his head, for what he gives with one hand he takes away with the other there is no sense whatever in it!\" Then the King offered Brother Lustig whatsoever he wished to have, but he did not dare to take anything; however, by hints and cunning, he contrived to make the King order his knapsack to be filled with gold for him, and with that he departed. When he got out, St. Peter was standing by the door, and said, \"Just look what a man thou art; did I not forbid thee to take anything, and there thou hast thy knapsack full of gold!\" - \"How can I help that,\" answered Brother Lustig, \"if people will put it in for me?\" - \"Well, I tell thee this, that if ever thou settest about anything of this kind again thou shalt suffer for it!\" - \"Eh, brother, have no fear, now I have money, why should I trouble myself with washing bones?\" - \"Faith,\" said St. Peter, \"the gold will last a long time! In order that after this thou mayst never tread in forbidden paths, I will bestow on thy knapsack this property, namely, that whatsoever thou wishest to have inside it, shall be there. Farewell, thou wilt now never see me more.\" - \"Good-bye,\" said Brother Lustig, and thought to himself, \"I am very glad that thou hast taken thyself off, thou strange fellow; I shall certainly not follow thee.\" But of the magical power which had been bestowed on his knapsack, he thought no more.\n\nBrother Lustig travelled about with his money, and squandered and wasted what he had as before. When at last he had no more than four kreuzers, he passed by an inn and thought, \"The money must go,\" and ordered three kreuzers\' worth of wine and one kreuzer\'s worth of bread for himself. As he was sitting there drinking, the smell of roast goose made its way to his nose. Brother Lustig looked about and peeped, and saw that the host had two geese standing in the oven. Then he remembered that his comrade had said that whatsoever he wished to have in his knapsack should be there, so he said, \"Oh, ho! I must try that with the geese.\" So he went out, and when he was outside the door, he said, \"I wish those two roasted geese out of the oven and in my knapsack,\" and when he had said that, he unbuckled it and looked in, and there they were inside it. \"Ah, that\'s right!\" said he, \"now I am a made man!\" and went away to a meadow and took out the roast meat. When he was in the midst of his meal, two journeymen came up and looked at the second goose, which was not yet touched, with hungry eyes. Brother Lustig thought to himself, \"One is enough for me,\" and called the two men up and said, \"Take the goose, and eat it to my health.\" They thanked him, and went with it to the inn, ordered themselves a half bottle of wine and a loaf, took out the goose which had been given them, and began to eat. The hostess saw them and said to her husband, \"Those two are eating a goose; just look and see if it is not one of ours, out of the oven.\" The landlord ran thither, and behold the oven was empty! \"What!\" cried he, \"you thievish crew, you want to eat goose as cheap as that? Pay for it this moment; or I will wash you well with green hazel-sap.\" The two said, \"We are no thieves, a discharged soldier gave us the goose, outside there in the meadow.\" - \"You shall not throw dust in my eyes that way! the soldier was here but he went out by the door, like an honest fellow. I looked after him myself; you are the thieves and shall pay!\" But as they could not pay, he took a stick, and cudgeled them out of the house.\n\nBrother Lustig went his way and came to a place where there was a magnificent castle, and not far from it a wretched inn. He went to the inn and asked for a night\'s lodging, but the landlord turned him away, and said, \"There is no more room here, the house is full of noble guests.\" - \"It surprises me that they should come to you and not go to that splendid castle,\" said Brother Lustig. \"Ah, indeed,\" replied the host, \"but it is no slight matter to sleep there for a night; no one who has tried it so far, has ever come out of it alive.\"\n\n\"If others have tried it,\" said Brother Lustig, \"I will try it too.\"\n\n\"Leave it alone,\" said the host, \"it will cost you your neck.\" - \"It won\'t kill me at once,\" said Brother Lustig, \"just give me the key, and some good food and wine.\" So the host gave him the key, and food and wine, and with this Brother Lustig went into the castle, enjoyed his supper, and at length, as he was sleepy, he lay down on the ground, for there was no bed. He soon fell asleep, but during the night was disturbed by a great noise, and when he awoke, he saw nine ugly devils in the room, who had made a circle, and were dancing around him. Brother Lustig said, \"Well, dance as long as you like, but none of you must come too close.\" But the devils pressed continually nearer to him, and almost stepped on his face with their hideous feet. \"Stop, you devils\' ghosts,\" said he, but they behaved still worse. Then Brother Lustig grew angry, and cried, \"Hola! but I will soon make it quiet,\" and got the leg of a chair and struck out into the midst of them with it. But nine devils against one soldier were still too many, and when he struck those in front of him, the others seized him behind by the hair, and tore it unmercifully. \"Devils\' crew,\" cried he, \"it is getting too bad, but wait. Into my knapsack, all nine of you!\" In an instant they were in it, and then he buckled it up and threw it into a corner. After this all was suddenly quiet, and Brother Lustig lay down again, and slept till it was bright day. Then came the inn-keeper, and the nobleman to whom the castle belonged, to see how he had fared; but when they perceived that he was merry and well they were astonished, and asked, \"Have the spirits done you no harm, then?\" - \"The reason why they have not,\" answered Brother Lustig, \"is because I have got the whole nine of them in my knapsack! You may once more inhabit your castle quite tranquilly, none of them will ever haunt it again.\" The nobleman thanked him, made him rich presents, and begged him to remain in his service, and he would provide for him as long as he lived. \"No,\" replied Brother Lustig, \"I am used to wandering about, I will travel farther.\" Then he went away, and entered into a smithy, laid the knapsack, which contained the nine devils on the anvil, and asked the smith and his apprentices to strike it. So they smote with their great hammers with all their strength, and the devils uttered howls which were quite pitiable. When he opened the knapsack after this, eight of them were dead, but one which had been lying in a fold of it, was still alive, slipped out, and went back again to hell. Thereupon Brother Lustig travelled a long time about the world, and those who know them can tell many a story about him, but at last he grew old, and thought of his end, so he went to a hermit who was known to be a pious man, and said to him, \"I am tired of wandering about, and want now to behave in such a manner that I shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven.\" The hermit replied, \"There are two roads, one is broad and pleasant, and leads to hell, the other is narrow and rough, and leads to heaven.\" - \"I should be a fool,\" thought Brother Lustig, \"if I were to take the narrow, rough road.\" So he set out and took the broad and pleasant road, and at length came to a great black door, which was the door of Hell. Brother Lustig knocked, and the door-keeper peeped out to see who was there. But when he saw Brother Lustig, he was terrified, for he was the very same ninth devil who had been shut up in the knapsack, and had escaped from it with a black eye. So he pushed the bolt in again as quickly as he could, ran to the devil\'s lieutenant, and said, \"There is a fellow outside with a knapsack, who wants to come in, but as you value your lives don\'t allow him to enter, or he will wish the whole of hell into his knapsack. He once gave me a frightful hammering when I was inside it.\" So they called out to Brother Lustig that he was to go away again, for he should not get in there! \"If they won\'t have me here,\" thought he, \"I will see if I can find a place for myself in heaven, for I must be somewhere.\" So he turned about and went onwards until he came to the door of Heaven, where he knocked. St. Peter was sitting hard by as door-keeper. Brother Lustig recognised him at once, and thought, \"Here I find an old friend, I shall get on better.\" But St. Peter said, \"I really believe that thou wantest to come into Heaven.\" - \"Let me in, brother; I must get in somewhere; if they would have taken me into Hell, I should not have come here.\" - \"No,\" said St. Peter, \"thou shalt not enter.\" - \"Then if thou wilt not let me in, take thy knapsack back, for I will have nothing at all from thee.\" - \"Give it here, then,\" said St. Peter. Then Brother Lustig gave him the knapsack into Heaven through the bars, and St. Peter took it, and hung it beside his seat. Then said Brother Lustig, \"And now I wish myself inside my knapsack,\" and in a second he was in it, and in Heaven, and St. Peter was forced to let him stay there.</string>
    <string name="story298text">The brother took his sister\'s hand and said to her, \"Since our mother died we have had no good days; our stepmother beats us every day, and if we go near her she kicks us away; we have nothing to eat but hard crusts of bread left over; the dog under the table fares better,\" he gets a good piece every now and then. If our mother only knew, how she would pity us! Come, let us go together out into the wide world!\" So they went, and journeyed the whole day through fields and meadows and stony places, and if it rained the sister said, \"The skies and we are weeping together.\" In the evening they came to a great wood, and they were so weary with hunger and their long journey, that they climbed up into a high tree and fell asleep.\n\nThe next morning, when they awoke, the sun was high in heaven, and shone brightly through the leaves. Then said the brother, \"Sister, I am thirsty; if I only knew where to find a brook, that I might go and drink! I almost think that I hear one rushing.\"\n\nSo the brother got down and led his sister by the hand, and they went to seek the brook. But their wicked stepmother was a witch, and had known quite well that the two children had run away, and had sneaked after them, as only witches can, and had laid a spell on all the brooks in the forest.\n\nSo when they found a little stream flowing smoothly over its pebbles, the brother was going to drink of it; but the sister heard how it said in its rushing, \"He a tiger will be who drinks of me, Who drinks of me a tiger will be!\"\n\nThen the sister cried, \"Pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wild beast, and will tear me in pieces.\"\n\nSo the brother refrained from drinking, though his thirst was great, and he said he would wait till he came to the next brook. When they came to a second brook the sister heard it say, \"He a wolf will be who drinks of me, Who drinks of me a wolf will be!\"\n\nThen the sister cried, \"Pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will be turned into a wolf, and will eat me up!\"\n\nSo the brother refrained from drinking, and said, \"I will wait until we come to the next brook, and then I must drink, whatever you say; my thirst is so great.\"\n\nAnd when they came to the third brook the sister heard how in its rushing it said, \"Who drinks of me a fawn will be, He a fawn will be who drinks of me!\"\n\nThen the sister said, \"O my brother, I pray drink not, or you will be turned into a fawn, and run away far from me.\"\n\nBut he had already kneeled by the side of the brook and stooped and drunk of the water, and as the first drops passed his lips he became a fawn.\n\nAnd the sister wept over her poor lost brother, and the fawn wept also, and stayed sadly beside her. At last the maiden said, \"Be comforted, dear fawn, indeed I will never leave you.\" Then she untied her golden girdle and bound it round the fawn\'s neck, and went and gathered rushes to make a soft cord, which she fastened to him; and then she led him on, and they went deeper into the forest. And when they had gone a long long way, they came at last to a little house, and the maiden looked inside, and as it was empty she thought, \"We might as well live here.\" And she fetched leaves and moss to make a soft bed for the fawn, and every morning she went out and gathered roots and berries and nuts for herself, and fresh grass for the fawn, who ate out of her hand with joy, frolicking round her. At night, when the sister was tired, and had said her prayers, she laid her head on the fawn\'s back, which served her for a pillow, and softly fell asleep. And if only the brother could have got back his own shape again, it would have been a charming life.\n\nSo they lived a long while in the wilderness alone. Now it happened that the King of that country held a great hunt in the forest. The blowing of the horns, the barking of the dogs, and the lusty shouts of the huntsmen sounded through the wood, and the fawn heard them and was eager to be among them.\n\n\"Oh,\" said he to his sister,\" do let me go to the hunt; I cannot stay behind any longer,\" and begged so long that at last she consented.\n\n\"But mind,\" said she to him,\" come back to me at night. I must lock my door against the wild hunters, so, in order that I may know you, you must knock and say, \' Little sister, let me in,\' and unless I hear that I shall not unlock the door.\" Then the fawn sprang out, and felt glad and merry in the open air. The King and his huntsmen saw the beautiful animal, and began at once to pursue him, but they could not come within reach of him, for when they thought they were certain of him he sprang away over the bushes and disappeared. As soon as it was dark he went back to the little house, knocked at the door, and said, \"Little sister, let me in.\" Then the door was opened to him, and he went in, and rested the whole night long on his soft bed.\n\nThe next morning the hunt began anew, and when the fawn heard the hunting-horns and the tally-ho of the huntsmen he could rest no longer, and said, \"Little sister, let me out, I must go\"\n\nThe sister opened the door and said, \"Now, mind you must come back at night and say the same words.\" When the King and his hunters saw the fawn with the golden collar again, they chased him closely, but he was too nimble and swift for them. This lasted the whole day, and at last the hunters surrounded him, and one of them wounded his foot a little, so that he was obliged to limp and to go slowly. Then a hunter slipped after him to the little house, and heard how he called out,\" Little sister, let me in,\" and saw the door open and shut again after him directly., The hunter noticed all this carefully, went to the King, and told him all he had seen and heard. Then said the King, \"To-morrow we will hunt again.\"\n\nBut the sister was very terrified when she saw that her fawn was wounded. She washed his foot, laid cooling leaves round it, and said,\" Lie down on your bed, dear fawn, and rest, that you may be soon well.\" The wound was very slight, so that the fawn felt nothing of it the next morning. And when he heard the noise of the hunting outside, he said, \"I cannot stay in, I must go after them; I shall not be taken easily again!\"\n\nThe sister began to weep, and said, \"I know you will be killed, and I left alone here in the forest, and forsaken of everybody. I cannot let you go!\"\n\n\"Then I shall die here with longing,\" answered the fawn;\" when I hear the sound of the horn I feel as if I should leap out of my skin.\"\n\nThen the sister, seeing there was no help for it, unlocked the door with a heavy heart, and the fawn bounded away into the forest, well and merry.\n\nWhen the King saw him, he said to his hunters, \"Now, follow him up all day long till the night comes, and see that you do him no hurt.\" So as soon as the sun had gone down, the King said to the huntsmen:\" Now, come and show me the little house in the wood.\" And when he got to the door he knocked at it, and cried, \"Little sister, let me in!\" Then the door opened, and the King went in, and there stood a maiden more beautiful than any he had seen before. The maiden shrieked out when she saw, instead of the fawn, a man standing there with a gold crown on his head. But the King looked kindly on her, took her by the hand, and said, \"Will you go with me to my castle, and be my dear wife?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" answered the maiden, \"but the fawn must come too. I could not leave him.\" And the King said, \"He shall remain with you as long as you live, and shall lack nothing.\" Then the fawn came bounding in, and the sister tied the cord of rushes to him, and led him by her own hand out of the little house.\n\nThe King put the beautiful maiden on his horse, and carried her to his castle, where the wedding was held with great pomp; so she became lady Queen, and they lived together happily for a long while; the fawn was well tended and cherished, and he gambolled about the castle garden. Now the wicked stepmother, whose fault it was that the children were driven out into the world, never dreamed but that the sister had been eaten up by wild beasts in the forest, and that the brother, in the likeness of a fawn, had been slain by the hunters. But when she heard that they were so happy, and that things had gone so well with them, jealousy and envy arose in her heart, and left her no peace, and her chief thought was how to bring misfortune upon them. Her own daughter, who was as ugly as sin, and had only one eye, complained to her, and said, \"I never had the chance of being a Queen.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said the old woman, to satisfy her;\" when the time comes, I shall be at hand.\" After a while the Queen brought a beautiful baby-boy into the world, and that day the King was out hunting. The old witch took the shape of the bedchamber woman, and went into the room where the Queen lay, and said to her, \"Come, the bath is ready; it will give you refreshment and new strength. Quick, or it will be cold.\" Her daughter was within call, so they carried the sick Queen into the bath-room, and left her there. And in the bath-room they had made a great fire, so as to suffocate the beautiful young Queen.\n\nWhen that was managed, the old woman took her daughter, put a cap on her, and laid her in the bed in the Queen\'s place, gave her also the Queen\'s form and countenance, only she could not restore the lost eye. So, in order that the King might not remark it, she had to lie on the side where there was no eye. In the evening, when the King came home and heard that a little son was born to him, he rejoiced with all his heart, and was going at once to his dear wife\'s bedside to see how she did. Then the old woman cried hastily, \"For your life, do not draw back the curtains, to let in the light upon her; she must be kept quiet.\" So the King went away, and never knew that a false Queen was lying in the bed.\n\nNow, when it was midnight, and every one was asleep, the nurse, who was sitting by the cradle in the nursery and watching there alone, saw the door open, and the true Queen come in. She took the child out of the cradle, laid it in her bosom, and fed it. Then she shook out its little pillow, put the child back again, and covered it with the coverlet. She did not forget the fawn either: she went to him where he lay in the corner, and stroked his back tenderly. Then she went in perfect silence out at the door, and the nurse next morning asked the watchmen if any one had entered the castle during the night, but they said they had seen no one.\n\nAnd the Queen came many nights, and never said a word; the nurse saw her always, but she did not dare speak of it to any one.\n\nAfter some time had gone by in this manner, the Queen seemed to find voice, and said one night,\n\n\"My child my fawn twice more I come to see,\nTwice more I come, and then the end must be.\"\n\nThe nurse said nothing, but as soon as the Queen had disappeared she went to the King and told him all. The King said, \"Ah, heaven! what do I hear! I will myself watch by the child to-morrow night.\" So at evening he went into the nursery, and at midnight the Queen appeared, and said,\n\n\"My child my fawn once more I come to see,\nOnce more I come, and then the end must be.\"\n\nAnd she tended the child, as she was accustomed to do, before she vanished. The King dared not speak to her, but he watched again the following night, and heard her say,\n\n\"My child my fawn this once I come to see,\nThis once I come, and now the end must be.\"\n\nThen the King could contain himself no longer, but rushed towards her, saying, \"You are no other than my dear wife!\"\n\nThen she answered, \"Yes, I am your dear wife,\" and in that moment, by the grace of heaven, her life returned to her, and she was once more well and strong. Then she told the King the snare that the wicked witch and her daughter had laid for her.\n\nThe King had them both brought to judgment, and sentence was passed upon them. The daughter was sent away into the wood, where she was devoured by the wild beasts, and the witch was burned, and ended miserably. And as soon as her body was in ashes the spell was removed from the fawn, and he took human shape again; and then the sister and brother lived happily together until the end.</string>
    <string name="story299text">A cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship that he felt for her, that at last the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together. \"But we must make preparations for winter, or else we shall suffer from hunger,\" said the cat, \"and you, little mouse, cannot venture out everywhere, or in the end you will be caught in a trap.\" This good advice was followed, and they bought a pot of fat, but they did not know where to store it. Finally, after much consideration, the cat said, \"I know of no place where it will be better stored up than in the church. No one dares take anything away from there. We will put it beneath the altar, and not touch it until we are need it.\" So the pot was stored safely away, but it was not long before the cat took a great longing for it, and said to the mouse, \"I wanted to tell you, little mouse, that my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and she has asked me to be his godfather. He is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the baptismal font. Let me go out today, and you look after the house by yourself.\" - \"Yes, yes,\" answered the mouse. \"By all means go, and if you get anything good to eat, think of me. I would like to drink a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.\" All this, however, was untrue. The cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godfather. He went straight to the church, crept up to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked off the top of the fat. Then he went for a stroll on the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched out in the sun, licking his whiskers whenever he thought of the pot of fat. He did not return home until it was evening. \"Well, here you are again,\" said the mouse. \"You must have had a happy day.\" - \"Everything went well,\" answered the cat. \"What name did they give the child?\" asked the mouse. \"Top-Off,\" said the cat quite coolly. \"Top-Off?\" cried the mouse. \"That is a very odd and uncommon name. Is it a usual one in your family?\" - \"What does that matter?\" said the cat. \"It is no worse than Crumb-Thief, as your godchildren are called.\"\n\nBefore long the cat was seized by another fit of longing. He said to the mouse, \"You must do me a favor, and once more manage the house alone for a day. I have been asked again to be godfather, and since the child has a white ring around its neck, I cannot refuse.\" The good mouse consented. However, the cat crept behind the town wall to the church, and devoured half the pot of fat. \"Nothing tastes as good as that which one eats by oneself,\" he said, and was quite satisfied with his day\'s work. When he arrived home the mouse asked, \"What name was this child christened with?\" - \"Half-Gone,\" answered the cat. \"Half-Gone? What are you saying? I have never heard that name in all my life. I\'ll wager it is not in the almanac.\"\n\nThe cat\'s mouth soon again began to water for the delicious goods. \"All good things come in threes,\" he said to the mouse. \"I have been asked to be godfather again. The child is totally black, only it has white paws. Otherwise it has not a single white hair on its whole body. This only happens once every few years. You will let me go, won\'t you?\" - \"Top-Off. Half-Gone,\" answered the mouse. \"They are such odd names, that they make me stop and think.\" - \"Here you sit at home,\" said the cat, \"with your dark gray fur coat and long braid of hair capturing fantasies. That is because you do not go out in the daytime.\" During the cat\'s absence the mouse cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat devoured all the rest of the fat. \"One has peace only after everything is eaten up,\" he said to himself. Well filled and fat, he did not return home until nighttime. The mouse immediately asked what name had been given to the third child. \"You will not like it either,\" said the cat. \"His name is All-Gone.\" - \"All-Gone!,\" cried the mouse. \"That is the most worrisome name of all. I have never seen it in print. All-Gone! What can that mean?\" Then she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay down to sleep.\n\nFrom this time forth no one invited the cat to be godfather, but when winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside, the mouse thought of their stored food, and said, \"Come cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves. It will taste good now.\" - \"Yes,\" answered the cat. \"You will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window.\" They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of fat, to be sure, was still in its place, but it was empty. \"Alas,\" said the mouse, \"now I see what has happened. Now it comes to light. You are a true friend. You ate everything when you were serving as a godfather. First top off, then half done, then…\" - \"Be quiet!\" cried the cat. \"One more word, and I will eat you too.\"\n\n\"All gone,\" was already on the poor mouse\'s lips. She had scarcely spoken it before the cat sprang on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. You see, that is the way of the world.</string>
    <string name="story300text">There was once a rich man whose wife lay sick, and when she felt her end drawing near she called to her only daughter to come near her bed, and said, \"Dear child, be pious and good, and God will always take care of you, and I will look down upon you from heaven, and will be with you.\" And then she closed her eyes and expired. The maiden went every day to her mother\'s grave and wept, and was always pious and good. When the winter came the snow covered the grave with a white covering, and when the sun came in the early spring and melted it away, the man took to himself another wife.\n\nThe new wife brought two daughters home with her, and they were beautiful and fair in appearance, but at heart were, black and ugly. And then began very evil times for the poor step-daughter. \"Is the stupid creature to sit in the same room with us?\" said they; \"those who eat food must earn it. Out upon her for a kitchen-maid!\" They took away her pretty dresses, and put on her an old grey kirtle, and gave her wooden shoes to wear. \"Just look now at the proud princess, how she is decked out!\" cried they laughing, and then they sent her into the kitchen. There she was obliged to do heavy work from morning to night, get up early in the morning, draw water, make the fires, cook, and wash. Besides that, the sisters did their utmost to torment her, mocking her, and strewing peas and lentils among the ashes, and setting her to pick them up. In the evenings, when she was quite tired out with her hard day\'s work, she had no bed to lie on, but was obliged to rest on the hearth among the cinders. And as she always looked dusty and dirty, they named her Cinderella.\n\nIt happened one day that the father went to the fair, and he asked his two step-daughters what he should bring back for them. \"Fine clothes!\" said one. \"Pearls and jewels!\" said the other. \"But what will you have, Cinderella?\" said he. \"The first twig, father, that strikes against your hat on the way home; that is what I should like you to bring me.\" So he bought for the two step-daughters fine clothes, pearls, and jewels, and on his way back, as he rode through a green lane, a hazel-twig struck against his hat; and he broke it off and carried it home with him. And when he reached home he gave to the step-daughters what they had wished for, and to Cinderella he gave the hazel-twig. She thanked him, and went to her mother\'s grave, and planted this twig there, weeping so bitterly that the tears fell upon it and watered it, and it flourished and became a fine tree. Cinderella went to see it three times a day, and wept and prayed, and each time a white bird rose up from the tree, and if she uttered any wish the bird brought her whatever she had wished for.\n\nNow if came to pass that the king ordained a festival that should last for three days, and to which all the beautiful young women of that country were bidden, so that the king\'s son might choose a bride from among them. When the two stepdaughters heard that they too were bidden to appear, they felt very pleased, and they called Cinderella, and said, \"Comb our hair, brush our shoes, and make our buckles fast, we are going to the wedding feast at the king\'s castle.\" Cinderella, when she heard this, could not help crying, for she too would have liked to go to the dance, and she begged her step-mother to allow her. \"What, you Cinderella!\" said she, \"in all your dust and dirt, you want to go to the festival! you that have no dress and no shoes! you want to dance!\" But as she persisted in asking, at last the step-mother said, \"I have strewed a dish-full of lentils in the ashes, and if you can pick them all up again in two hours you may go with us.\" Then the maiden went to the backdoor that led into the garden, and called out, \"O gentle doves, O turtle-doves, And all the birds that be, The lentils that in ashes lie Come and pick up for me!\nThe good must be put in the dish,\nThe bad you may eat if you wish.\"\nThen there came to the kitchen-window two white doves, and after them some turtle-doves, and at last a crowd of all the birds under heaven, chirping and fluttering, and they alighted among the ashes; and the doves nodded with their heads, and began to pick, peck, pick, peck, and then all the others began to pick, peck, pick, peck, and put all the good grains into the dish. Before an hour was over all was done, and they flew away. Then the maiden brought the dish to her step-mother, feeling joyful, and thinking that now she should go to the feast; but the step-mother said, \"No, Cinderella, you have no proper clothes, and you do not know how to dance, and you would be laughed at!\" And when Cinderella cried for disappointment, she added, \"If you can pick two dishes full of lentils out of the ashes, nice and clean, you shall go with us,\" thinking to herself, \"for that is not possible.\" When she had strewed two dishes full of lentils among the ashes the maiden went through the backdoor into the garden, and cried, \"O gentle doves, O turtle-doves, And all the birds that be, The lentils that in ashes lie Come and pick up for me!\nThe good must be put in the dish,\nThe bad you may eat if you wish.\"\nSo there came to the kitchen-window two white doves, and then some turtle-doves, and at last a crowd of all the other birds under heaven, chirping and fluttering, and they alighted among the ashes, and the doves nodded with their heads and began to pick, peck, pick, peck, and then all the others began to pick, peck, pick, peck, and put all the good grains into the dish. And before half-an-hour was over it was all done, and they flew away. Then the maiden took the dishes to the stepmother, feeling joyful, and thinking that now she should go with them to the feast; but she said \"All this is of no good to you; you cannot come with us, for you have no proper clothes, and cannot dance; you would put us to shame.\" Then she turned her back on poor Cinderella, and made haste to set out with her two proud daughters.\n\nAnd as there was no one left in the house, Cinderella went to her mother\'s grave, under the hazel bush, and cried,\n\"Little tree, little tree, shake over me,\nThat silver and gold may come down and cover me.\"\nThen the bird threw down a dress of gold and silver, and a pair of slippers embroidered with silk and silver. , And in all haste she put on the dress and went to the festival. But her step-mother and sisters did not know her, and thought she must be a foreign princess, she looked so beautiful in her golden dress. Of Cinderella they never thought at all, and supposed that she was sitting at home, arid picking the lentils out of the ashes. The King\'s son came to meet her, and took her by the hand and danced with her, and he refused to stand up with any one else, so that he might not be obliged to let go her hand; and when any one came to claim it he answered, \"She is my partner.\"\n\nAnd when the evening came she wanted to go home, but the prince said he would go with her to take care of her, for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But she escaped him, and jumped up into the pigeon-house. Then the prince waited until the father came, and told him the strange maiden had jumped into the pigeon-house. The father thought to himself, \"It cannot surely be Cinderella,\" and called for axes and hatchets, and had the pigeon-house cut down, but there was no one in it. And when they entered the house there sat Cinderella in her dirty clothes among the cinders, and a little oil-lamp burnt dimly in the chimney; for Cinderella had been very quick, and had jumped out of the pigeon-house again, and had run to the hazel bush; and there she had taken off her beautiful dress and had laid it on the grave, and the bird had carried it away again, and then she had put on her little gray kirtle again, and had sat down in. the kitchen among the cinders.\n\nThe next day, when the festival began anew, and the parents and step-sisters had gone to it, Cinderella went to the hazel bush and cried,\n\"Little tree, little tree, shake over me,\nThat silver and gold may come down and cover me.\"\nThen the bird cast down a still more splendid dress than on the day before. And when she appeared in it among the guests every one was astonished at her beauty. The prince had been waiting until she came, and he took her hand and danced with her alone. And when any one else came to invite her he said, \"She is my partner.\" And when the evening came she wanted to go home, and the prince followed her, for he wanted to see to what house she belonged; but she broke away from him, and ran into the garden at the back of the house. There stood a fine large tree, bearing splendid pears; she leapt as lightly as a squirrel among the branches, and the prince did not know what had become of her. So he waited until the father came, and then he told him that the strange maiden had rushed from him, and that he thought she had gone up into the pear-tree. The father thought to himself, \"It cannot surely be Cinderella,\" and called for an axe, and felled the tree, but there was no one in it. And when they went into the kitchen there sat Cinderella among the cinders, as usual, for she had got down the other side of the tree, and had taken back her beautiful clothes to the bird on the hazel bush, and had put on her old grey kirtle again.\n\nOn the third day, when the parents and the step-children had set off, Cinderella went again to her mother\'s grave, and said to the tree,\n\"Little tree, little tree, shake over me,\nThat silver and gold may come down and cover me.\"\nThen the bird cast down a dress, the like of which had never been seen for splendour and brilliancy, and slippers that were of gold. And when she appeared in this dress at the feast nobody knew what to say for wonderment. The prince danced with her alone, and if any one else asked her he answered, \"She is my partner.\"\n\nAnd when it was evening Cinderella wanted to go home, and the prince was about to go with her, when she ran past him so quickly that he could not follow her. But he had laid a plan, and had caused all the steps to be spread with pitch, so that as she rushed down them the left shoe of the maiden remained sticking in it. The prince picked it up, and saw that it was of gold, and very small and slender. The next morning he went to the father and told him that none should be his bride save the one whose foot the golden shoe should fit. Then the two sisters were very glad, because they had pretty feet. The eldest went to her room to try on the shoe, and her mother stood by. But she could not get her great toe into it, for the shoe was too small; then her mother handed her a knife, and said, \"Cut the toe off, for when you are queen you will never have to go on foot.\" So the girl cut her toe off, squeezed her foot into the shoe, concealed the pain, and went down to the prince. Then he took her with him on his horse as his bride, and rode off. They had to pass by the grave, and there sat the two pigeons on the hazel bush, and cried,\n\"There they go, there they go!\nThere is blood on her shoe;\nThe shoe is too small,\nNot the right bride at all!\"\nThen the prince looked at her shoe, and saw the blood flowing. And he turned his horse round and took the false bride home again, saying she was not the right one, and that the other sister must try on the shoe. So she went into her room to do so, and got her toes comfortably in, but her heel was too large. Then her mother handed her the knife, saying, \"Cut a piece off your heel; when you are queen you will never have to go on foot.\" So the girl cut a piece off her heel, and thrust her foot into the shoe, concealed the pain, and went down to the prince, who took his bride before him on his horse and rode off. When they passed by the hazel bush the two pigeons sat there and cried,\n\"There they go, there they go!\nThere is blood on her shoe;\nThe shoe is too small,\nNot the right bride at all!\"\nThen the prince looked at her foot, and saw how the blood was flowing from the shoe, and staining the white stocking. And he turned his horse round and brought the false bride home again. \"This is not the right one,\" said he, \"have you no other daughter?\" - \"No,\" said the man, \"only my dead wife left behind her a little stunted Cinderella; it is impossible that she can be the bride.\" But the King\'s son ordered her to be sent for, but the mother said, \"Oh no! she is much too dirty, I could not let her be seen.\" But he would have her fetched, and so Cinderella had to appear. First she washed her face and hands quite clean, and went in and curtseyed to the prince, who held out to her the golden shoe. Then she sat down on a stool, drew her foot out of the heavy wooden shoe, and slipped it into the golden one, which fitted it perfectly. And when she stood up, and the prince looked in her face, he knew again the beautiful maiden that had danced with him, and he cried, \"This is the right bride!\" The step-mother and the two sisters were thunderstruck, and grew pale with anger; but he put Cinderella before him on his horse and rode off. And as they passed the hazel bush, the two white pigeons cried,\n\"There they go, there they go!\nNo blood on her shoe;\nThe shoe\'s not too small,\nThe right bride is she after all.\"\nAnd when they had thus cried, they came flying after and perched on Cinderella\'s shoulders, one on the right, the other on the left, and so remained.\n\nAnd when her wedding with the prince was appointed to be held the false sisters came, hoping to curry favour, and to take part in the festivities. So as the bridal procession went to the church, the eldest walked on the right side and the younger on the left, and the pigeons picked out an eye of each of them. And as they returned the elder was on the left side and the younger on the right, and the pigeons picked out the other eye of each of them. And so they were condemned to go blind for the rest of their days because of their wickedness and falsehood.</string>
    <string name="story301text">There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Else, and when she was grown up, her father said she must be married, and her mother said, \"Yes, if we could only find some one that would consent to have.\" At last one came from a distance, and his name was Hans, and when he proposed to her, he made it a condition that Clever Else should be very careful as well. \"Oh,\" said the father, \"she does not want for brains.\" - \"No, indeed,\" said the mother, \"she can see the wind coming up the street and hear the flies cough.\" - \"Well,\" said Hans, \"if she does not turn out to be careful too, I will not have her.\" Now when they were all seated at table, and had well eaten, the mother said, \"Else, go into the cellar and draw some beer.\" Then Clever Else took down the jug from the hook in the wall, and as she was on her way to the cellar she rattled the lid up and down so as to pass away the time. When she got there, she took a stool and stood it in front of the cask, so that she need not stoop and make her back ache with needless trouble. Then she put the jug under the tap and turned it, and while the beer was running, in order that her eyes should not be idle, she glanced hither and thither, and finally caught sight of a pickaxe that the workmen had left sticking in the ceiling just above her head. Then Clever Else began to cry, for she thought, \"If I marry Hans, and we have a child, and it grows big, and we send it into the cellar to draw beer, that pickaxe might fall on his head and kill him.\" So there she sat and cried with all her might, lamenting the anticipated misfortune. All the while they were waiting upstairs for something to drink, and they waited in vain. At last the mistress said to the maid, \"Go down to the cellar and see why Else does not come.\" So the maid went, and found her sitting in front of the cask crying with all her might. \"What are you crying for?\" said the maid. \"Oh dear me,\" answered she, \"how can I help crying? if I marry Hans, and we have a child, and it grows big, and we send it here to draw beer, perhaps the pickaxe may fall on its head and kill it.\" - \"Our Else is clever indeed!\" said the maid, and directly sat down to bewail the anticipated misfortune. After a while, when the people upstairs found that the maid did not return, and they were becoming more and more thirsty, the master said to the boy, \"You go down into the cellar, and see what Else and the maid are doing.\" The boy did so, and there he found both Clever Else and the maid sitting crying together. Then he asked what was the matter. \"Oh dear me,\" said Else, \"how can we help crying? If I marry Hans, and we have a child, and it grows big, and we send it here to draw beer, the pickaxe might fall on its head and kill it.\" - \"Our Else is clever indeed!\" said the boy, and sitting down beside her, he began howling with a good will. Upstairs they were all waiting for him to come back, but as he did not come, the master said to the mistress, \"You go down to the cellar and see what Else is doing.\" So the mistress went down and found all three in great lamentations, and when she asked the cause, then Else told her how the future possible child might be killed as soon as it was big enough to be sent to draw beer, by the pickaxe falling on it. Then the mother at once exclaimed, \"Our Else is clever indeed!\" and, sitting down, she wept with the rest. Upstairs the husband waited a little while, but as his wife did not return, and as his thirst constantly increased, he said, \"I must go down to the cellar myself, and see what has become of Else.\" And when he came into the cellar, and found them all sitting and weeping together, he was told that it was all owing to the child that Else might possibly have, and the possibility of its being killed by the pickaxe so happening to fall just at the time the child might be sitting underneath it drawing beer; and when he heard all this, he cried, \"How clever is our Else!\" and sitting down, he joined his tears to theirs. The intended bridegroom stayed upstairs by himself a long time, but as nobody came back to him, he thought he would go himself and see what they were all about And there he found all five lamenting and crying most pitifully, each one louder than the other. \"What misfortune has happened?\" cried he. \"O my dear Hans,\" said Else, \"if we marry and have a child, and it grows big, and we send it down here to draw beer, perhaps that pickaxe which has been left sticking up there might fall down on the child\'s head and kill it; and how can we help crying at that!\" - \"Now,\" said Hans, \"I cannot think that greater sense than that could be wanted in my household; so as you are so clever, Else, I will have you for my wife,\" and taking her by the hand he led her upstairs, and they had the wedding at once.\n\nA little while after they were married, Hans said to his wife, \"I am going out to work, in order to get money; you go into the field and cut the corn, so that we may have bread.\" - \"Very well, I will do so, dear Hans,\" said she. And after Hans was gone she cooked herself some nice stew, and took it with her into the field. And when she got there, she said to herself, \"Now, what shall I do? shall I reap first, or eat first? All right, I will eat first.\" Then she ate her fill of stew, and when she could eat no more, she said to herself, \"Now, what shall I do? shall I reap first, or sleep first? All right, I will sleep first.\" Then she lay down in the corn and went to sleep. And Hans got home, and waited there a long while, and Else did not come, so he said to himself, \"My clever Else is so industrious that she never thinks of coming home and eating.\" But when evening drew near and still she did not come, Hans set out to see how much corn she had cut; but she had cut no corn at all, but there she was lying in it asleep. Then Hans made haste home, and fetched a bird-net with little bells and threw it over her; and still she went on sleeping. And he ran home again and locked himself in, and sat him down on his bench to work. At last, when it was beginning to grow dark, Clever Else woke, and when she got up and shook herself, the bells jingled at each movement that she made. Then she grew frightened, and began to doubt whether she were really Clever Else or not, and said to herself, \"Am I, or am I not?\" And, not knowing what answer to make, she stood for a long while considering; at last she thought, \"I will go home to Hans and ask him if I am I or not; he is sure to know.\" So she ran up to the door of her house, but it was locked; then she knocked at the window, and cried, \"Hans, is Else within?\" - \"Yes,\" answered Hans, \"she is in.\" Then she was in a greater fright than ever, and crying, \"Oh dear, then I am not I,\" she went to inquire at another door, but the people hearing the jingling of the bells would not open to her, and she could get in nowhere. So she ran away beyond the village, and since then no one has seen her.</string>
    <string name="story302text">There was once a cook named Grethel, who wore shoes with red rosettes, and when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that, and thought, \"You certainly are a pretty girl!\" And when she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine, and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she was cooking until she was satisfied, and said, \"The cook must know what the food is like.\"\nIt came to pass that the master one day said to her, \"Grethel, there is a guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.\" - \"I will see to it, master,\" answered Grethel. She killed two fowls, scalded them, plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before the fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Grethel called out to her master, \"If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten directly, when they are juiciest.\" The master said, \"I will run myself, and fetch the guest.\" When the master had turned his back, Grethel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought, \"Standing so long by the fire there, makes one hot and thirsty; who knows when they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a drink.\" She ran down, set a jug, said, \"God bless it to thy use, Grethel,\" and took a good drink, and took yet another hearty draught.\n\nThen she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them, and drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good, Grethel thought, \"Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!\" She touched it with her finger, and said, \"Ah! how good fowls are! It certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten directly!\" She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought, \"One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.\" So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she thought, \"the other must go down too, or else master will observe that something is missing.\" When the two wings were eaten, she went and looked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to her, \"Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in somewhere.\" Then she said, \"Hallo, Grethel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is eaten you will have some peace, why should God\'s good gifts be spoilt?\" So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the one chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down, and still her master did not come, Grethel looked at the other and said, \"Where one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what\'s right for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take another draught it would do me no harm.\" So she took another hearty drink, and let the second chicken rejoin the first.\n\nWhile she was just in the best of the eating, her master came and cried, hurry up, \"Haste thee, Grethel, the guest is coming directly after me!\" - \"Yes, sir, I will soon serve up,\" answered Grethel. Meantime the master looked to see that the table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was going to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently the guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door. Grethel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest, she put her finger to her lips and said, \"Hush! hush! get away as quickly as you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he certainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your two ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!\" The guest heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he could. Grethel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried, \"You have invited a fine guest!\" - \"Eh, why, Grethel? What do you mean by that?\" - \"Yes,\" said she, \"he has taken the chickens which I was just going to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!\" - \"That\'s a nice trick!\" said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. \"If he had but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.\" He called to him to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him with the knife still in his hand, crying, \"Just one, just one,\" meaning that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take them both home with him.</string>
    <string name="story303text">A countryman one day said to his little puppies: \"Come into the parlour and enjoy yourselves, and pick up the bread-crumbs on the table; your mistress has gone out to pay some visits.\" Then the little dogs said: \"No, no, we will not go. If the mistress gets to know it, she will beat us.\" The countryman said: \"She will know nothing about it. Do come; after all, she never gives you anything good.\" Then the little dogs again said: \"Nay, nay, we must let it alone; we must not go.\" But the countryman let them have no peace until at last they went, and got on the table, and ate up the bread-crumbs with all their might. But at that very moment the mistress came, and seized the stick in great haste, and beat them and treated them very hardly. And when they were outside the house, the little dogs said to the countryman: \"Dost, dost, dost, dost, dost thou see?\" Then the countryman laughed and said: \"Didn\'t, didn\'t, didn\'t, you expect it?\" So they just had to run away.</string>
    <string name="story304text">There was once an enchantress, who had three sons who loved each other as brothers, but the old woman did not trust them, and thought they wanted to steal her power from her. So she changed the eldest into an eagle, which was forced to dwell in the rocky mountains, and was often seen sweeping in great circles in the sky. The second, she changed into a whale, which lived in the deep sea, and all that was seen of it was that it sometimes spouted up a great jet of water in the air. Each of them only bore his human form for only two hours daily. The third son, who was afraid she might change him into a raging wild beast a bear perhaps, or a wolf, went secretly away. He had heard that a King\'s daughter who was bewitched, was imprisoned in the Castle of the Golden Sun, and was waiting for deliverance. Those, however, who tried to free her risked their lives; three-and-twenty youths had already died a miserable death, and now only one other might make the attempt, after which no more must come. And as his heart was without fear, he caught at the idea of seeking out the Castle of the Golden Sun. He had already travelled about for a long time without being able to find it, when he came by chance into a great forest, and did not know the way out of it. All at once he saw in the distance two giants, who made a sign to him with their hands, and when he came to them they said, \"We are quarrelling about a cap, and which of us it is to belong to, and as we are equally strong, neither of us can get the better of the other. The small men are cleverer than we are, so we will leave the decision to thee.\" - \"How can you dispute about an old cap?\" said the youth. \"Thou dost not know what properties it has! It is a wishing-cap; whosoever puts it on, can wish himself away wherever he likes, and in an instant he will be there.\" - \"Give me the cap,\" said the youth, \"I will go a short distance off, and when I call you, you must run a race, and the cap shall belong to the one who gets first to me.\" He put it on and went away, and thought of the King\'s daughter, forgot the giants, and walked continually onward. At length he sighed from the very bottom of his heart, and cried, \"Ah, if I were but at the Castle of the Golden Sun,\" and hardly had the words passed his lips than he was standing on a high mountain before the gate of the castle.\nHe entered and went through all the rooms, until in the last he found the King\'s daughter. But how shocked he was when he saw her. She had an ashen-gray face full of wrinkles, blear eyes, and red hair. \"Are you the King\'s daughter, whose beauty the whole world praises?\" cried he. \"Ah,\" she answered, \"this is not my form; human eyes can only see me in this state of ugliness, but that thou mayst know what I am like, look in the mirror it does not let itself be misled it will show thee my image as it is in truth.\" She gave him the mirror in his hand, and he saw therein the likeness of the most beautiful maiden on earth, and saw, too, how the tears were rolling down her cheeks with grief. Then said he, \"How canst thou be set free? I fear no danger.\" She said, \"He who gets the crystal ball, and holds it before the enchanter, will destroy his power with it, and I shall resume my true shape. Ah,\" she added, \"so many have already gone to meet death for this, and thou art so young; I grieve that thou shouldst encounter such great danger.\" - \"Nothing can keep me from doing it,\" said he, \"but tell me what I must do.\" - \"Thou shalt know everything,\" said the King\'s daughter; \"when thou descendest the mountain on which the castle stands, a wild bull will stand below by a spring, and thou must fight with it, and if thou hast the luck to kill it, a fiery bird will spring out of it, which bears in its body a burning egg, and in the egg the crystal ball lies like a yolk. The bird will not, however, let the egg fall until forced to do so, and if it falls on the ground, it will flame up and burn everything that is near, and melt even ice itself, and with it the crystal ball, and then all thy trouble will have been in vain.\"\n\nThe youth went down to the spring, where the bull snorted and bellowed at him. After a long struggle he plunged his sword in the animal\'s body, and it fell down. Instantly a fiery bird arose from it, and was about to fly away, but the young man\'s brother, the eagle, who was passing between the clouds, swooped down, hunted it away to the sea, and struck it with his beak until, in its extremity, it let the egg fall. The egg did not, however, fall into the sea, but on a fisherman\'s hut which stood on the shore and the hut began at once to smoke and was about to break out in flames. Then arose in the sea waves as high as a house, they streamed over the hut, and subdued the fire. The other brother, the whale, had come swimming to them, and had driven the water up on high. When the fire was extinguished, the youth sought for the egg and happily found it; it was not yet melted, but the shell was broken by being so suddenly cooled with the water, and he could take out the crystal ball unhurt.\n\nWhen the youth went to the enchanter and held it before him, the latter said, \"My power is destroyed, and from this time forth thou art the King of the Castle of the Golden Sun. With this canst thou likewise give back to thy brothers their human form.\" Then the youth hastened to the King\'s daughter, and when he entered the room, she was standing there in the full splendour of her beauty, and joyfully they exchanged rings with each other.</string>
    <string name="story305text">There was once on a time a princess who was extremely proud. If a wooer came she gave him some riddle to guess, and if he could not find it out, he was sent contemptuously away. She let it be made known also that whosoever solved her riddle should marry her, let him be who he might. At length, therefore, three tailors fell in with each other, the two eldest of whom thought they had done so many dexterous bits of work successfully that they could not fail to succeed in this also; the third was a little useless land-louper, who did not even know his trade, but thought he must have some luck in this venture, for where else was it to come from? Then the two others said to him, \"Just stay at home; thou canst not do much with thy little bit of understanding.\" The little tailor, however, did not let himself be discouraged, and said he had set his head to work about this for once, and he would manage well enough, and he went forth as if the whole world were his.\nThey all three announced themselves to the princess, and said she was to propound her riddle to them, and that the right persons were now come, who had understandings so fine that they could be threaded in a needle. Then said the princess, \"I have two kinds of hair on my head, of what color is it?\" - \"If that be all,\" said the first, \"it must be black and white, like the cloth which is called pepper and salt.\" The princess said, \"Wrongly guessed; let the second answer.\" Then said the second, \"If it be not black and white, then it is brown and red, like my father\'s company coat.\" - \"Wrongly guessed,\" said the princess, \"let the third give the answer, for I see very well he knows it for certain.\" Then the little tailor stepped boldly forth and said, \"The princess has a silver and a golden hair on her head, and those are the two different colors.\" When the princess heard that, she turned pale and nearly fell down with terror, for the little tailor had guessed her riddle, and she had firmly believed that no man on earth could discover it. When her courage returned she said, \"Thou hast not won me yet by that; there is still something else that thou must do. Below, in the stable is a bear with which thou shalt pass the night, and when I get up in the morning if thou art still alive, thou shalt marry me.\" She expected, however, she should thus get rid of the tailor, for the bear had never yet left any one alive who had fallen into his clutches. The little tailor did not let himself be frightened away, but was quite delighted, and said, \"Boldly ventured is half won.\"\n\nWhen therefore the evening came, our little tailor was taken down to the bear. The bear was about to set at the little fellow at once, and give him a hearty welcome with his paws: \"Softly, softly,\" said the little tailor, \"I will soon make thee quiet.\" Then quite composedly, and as if he had not an anxiety in the world, he took some nuts out of his pocket, cracked them, and ate the kernels. When the bear saw that, he was seized with a desire to have some nuts too. The tailor felt in his pockets, and reached him a handful; they were, however, not nuts, but pebbles. The bear put them in his mouth, but could get nothing out of them, let him bite as he would. \"Eh!\" thought he, \"what a stupid blockhead I am! I cannot even crack a nut!\" and then he said to the tailor, \"Here, crack me the nuts.\" - \"There, see what a stupid fellow thou art!\" said the little tailor, \"to have such a great mouth, and not be able to crack a small nut!\" Then he took the pebble and nimbly put a nut in his mouth in the place of it, and crack, it was in two! \"I must try the thing again,\" said the bear; \"when I watch you, I then think I ought to be able to do it too.\" So the tailor once more gave him a pebble, and the bear tried and tried to bite into it with all the strength of his body. But no one will imagine that he accomplished it. When that was over, the tailor took out a violin from beneath his coat, and played a piece of it to himself. When the bear heard the music, he could not help beginning to dance, and when he had danced a while, the thing pleased him so well that he said to the little tailor, \"Hark you, is the fiddle heavy?\" - \"Light enough for a child. Look, with the left hand I lay my fingers on it, and with the right I stroke it with the bow, and then it goes merrily, hop sa sa vivallalera!\" - \"So,\" said the bear; \"fiddling is a thing I should like to understand too, that I might dance whenever I had a fancy. What dost thou think of that? \"Wilt thou give me lessons?\" - \"With all my heart,\" said the tailor, \"if thou hast a talent for it. But just let me see thy claws, they are terribly long, I must cut thy nails a little.\" Then a vise was brought, and the bear put his claws in it, and the little tailor screwed it tight, and said, \"Now wait until I come with the scissors,\" and he let the bear growl as he liked, and lay down in the corner on a bundle of straw, and fell asleep.\n\nWhen the princess heard the bear growling so fiercely during the night, she believed nothing else but that he was growling for joy, and had made an end of the tailor. In the morning she arose careless and happy, but when she peeped into the stable, the tailor stood gaily before her, and was as healthy as a fish in water. Now she could not say another word against the wedding because she had given a promise before every one, and the King ordered a carriage to be brought in which she was to drive to church with the tailor, and there she was to be married. When they had got into the carriage, the two other tailors, who had false hearts and envied him his good fortune, went into the stable and unscrewed the bear again. The bear in great fury ran after the carriage. The princess heard him snorting and growling; she was terrified, and she cried, \"Ah, the bear is behind us and wants to get thee!\" The tailor was quick and stood on his head, stuck his legs out of the window, and cried, \"Dost thou see the vise? If thou dost not be off thou shalt be put into it again.\" When the bear saw that, he turned round and ran away. The tailor drove quietly to church, and the princess was married to him at once, and he lived with her as happy as a woodlark. Whosoever does not believe this, must pay a thaler.</string>
    <string name="story306text">A poor herder went along the shore of a large and stormy water, herding many white geese. To this on came Death over water, and was asked by the herder, whence he came from, and whence he wanted to go? Death answered, that he came out of the water and wanted to go out of the world. The poor gooseherder asked further: how does one go forth out of the world? Death said, that one had to go over the water into the new world, which lies beyond. The herder said, that he tired of this life, and asked Death, he should take him over with him. Death said, that it was not yet time, and he had now otherwise to do. But there was unfar from there a greedy-neck, he by night thought in his lair, how he could bring even more money and goods together, this one Death led the to the great water and pushed him in. Because he could no swim, he drowned to bottom, before he could reach the shore. His dogs and cats, who so ran after him, also drowned with him. Several days after that Death came also to the goose herder, found him singing merrily and said to him: \"Will you now go with me?\" He was willing and came with his white geese well over, which were all transformed into white sheep. The goose herder looked upon the beautiful land and heard, that the herders of the places became kings, and as he rightly looked about him, the chief herders Abraham, Isaac and Jacob came towards him, placed a kingly crown upon him, and led him to the herder\'s palace, there he is still to be found.</string>
    <string name="story307text">Once upon a time the little hen went with the little cock to the nut-hill, and they agreed together that whichsoever of them found a kernel of a nut should share it with the other. Then the hen found a large, large nut, but said nothing about it, intending to eat the kernel herself. The kernel, however, was so large that she could not swallow it, and it remained sticking in her throat, so that she was alarmed lest she should be choked. Then she cried, \"Cock, I entreat thee to run as fast thou canst, and fetch me some water, or I shall choke.\" The little cock did run as fast as he could to the spring, and said, \"Stream, thou art to give me some water; the little hen is lying on the nut- hill, and she has swallowed a large nut, and is choking.\" The well answered, \"First run to the bride, and get her to give thee some red silk.\" The little cock ran to the bride and said, \"Bride, you are to give me some red silk; I want to give red silk to the well, the well is to give me some water, I am to take the water to the little hen who is lying on the nut-hill and has swallowed a great nut-kernel, and is choking with it.\" The bride answered, \"First run and bring me my little wreath which is hanging to a willow.\" So the little cock ran to the willow, and drew the wreath from the branch and took it to the bride, and the bride gave him some water for it. Then the little cock took the water to the hen, but when he got there the hen had choked in the meantime, and lay there dead and motionless. Then the cock was so distressed that he cried aloud, and every animal came to lament the little hen, and six mice built a little carriage to carry her to her grave, and when the carriage was ready they harnessed themselves to it, and the cock drove. On the way, however, they met the fox, who said, \"Where art thou going, little cock?\" - \"I am going to bury my little hen.\" - \"May I drive with thee?\" - \"Yes, but seat thyself at the back of the carriage, for in the front my little horses could not drag thee.\" Then the fox seated himself at the back, and after that the wolf, the bear, the stag, the lion, and all the beasts of the forest did the same. Then the procession went onwards, and they reached the stream. \"How are we to get over?\" said the little cock. A straw was lying by the stream, and it said, \"I will lay myself across, and you shall drive over me.\" But when the six mice came to the bridge, the straw slipped and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in and were drowned. Then they were again in difficulty, and a coal came and said, \"I am large enough, I will lay myself across and you shall drive over me.\" So the coal also laid itself across the water, but unhappily just touched it, on which the coal hissed, was extinguished and died. When a stone saw that, it took pity on the little cock, wished to help him, and laid itself over the water. Then the cock drew the carriage himself, but when he got it over and reached the other shore with the dead hen, and was about to draw over the others who were sitting behind as well, there were too many of them, the carriage ran back, and they all fell into the water together, and were drowned. Then the little cock was left alone with the dead hen, and dug a grave for her and laid her in it, and made a mound above it, on which he sat down and fretted until he died too, and then every one was dead.</string>
    <string name="story308text">There was a great war, and the King had many soldiers, but gave them small pay, so small that they could not live upon it, so three of them agreed among themselves to desert. One of them said to the others, \"If we are caught we shall be hanged on the gallows; how shall we manage it?\" Another said, \"Look at that great cornfield, if we were to hide ourselves there, no one could find us; the troops are not allowed to enter it, and to-morrow they are to march away.\" They crept into the corn, only the troops did not march away, but remained lying all round about it. They stayed in the corn for two days and two nights, and were so hungry that they all but died, but if they had come out, their death would have been certain. Then said they, \"What is the use of our deserting if we have to perish miserably here?\" But now a fiery dragon came flying through the air, and it came down to them, and asked why they had concealed themselves there? They answered, \"We are three soldiers who have deserted because the pay was so bad, and now we shall have to die of hunger if we stay here, or to dangle on the gallows if we go out.\" - \"If you will serve me for seven years,\" said the dragon, \"I will convey you through the army so that no one shall seize you.\" - \"We have no choice and are compelled to accept,\" they replied. Then the dragon caught hold of them with his claws, and carried them away through the air over the army, and put them down again on the earth far from it; but the dragon was no other than the Devil. He gave them a small whip and said, \"Whip with it and crack it, and then as much gold will spring up round about as you can wish for; then you can live like great lords, keep horses, and drive your carriages, but when the seven years have come to an end, you are my property.\" Then he put before them a book which they were all three forced to sign. \"I will, however, then set you a riddle,\" said he, \"and if you can guess that, you shall be free, and released from my power.\" Then the dragon flew away from them, and they went away with their whip, had gold in plenty, ordered themselves rich apparel, and travelled about the world. Wherever they were they lived in pleasure and magnificence, rode on horseback, drove in carriages, ate and drank, but did nothing wicked. The time slipped quickly away, and when the seven years were coming to an end, two of them were terribly anxious and alarmed; but the third took the affair easily, and said, \"Brothers, fear nothing, my head is sharp enough, I shall guess the riddle.\" They went out into the open country and sat down, and the two pulled sorrowful faces. Then an aged woman came up to them who inquired why they were so sad? \"Alas!\" said they, \"how can that concern you? After all, you cannot help us.\" - \"Who knows?\" said she. \"confide your trouble to me.\" So they told her that they had been the Devil\'s servants for nearly seven years, and that he had provided them with gold as plentifully as if it had been blackberries, but that they had sold themselves to him, and were forfeited to him, if at the end of the seven years they could not guess a riddle.\" The old woman said, \"If you are to be saved, one of you must go into the forest, there he will come to a fallen rock which looks like a little house, he must enter that, and then he will obtain help.\" The two melancholy ones thought to themselves, \"That will still not save us,\" and stayed where they were, but the third, the merry one, got up and walked on in the forest until he found the rock-house. In the little house, however, a very aged woman was sitting, who was the Devil\'s grandmother, and asked the soldier where he came from, and what he wanted there? He told her everything that had happened, and as he pleased her well, she had pity on him, and said she would help him. She lifted up a great stone which lay above a cellar, and said, \"Conceal thyself there, thou canst hear everything that is said here; only sit still, and do not stir. When the dragon comes, I will question him about the riddle, he tells everything to me, so listen carefully to his answer.\" At twelve o\'clock at night, the dragon came flying thither, and asked for his dinner. The grandmother laid the table, and served up food and drink, so that he was pleased, and they ate and drank together. In the course of conversation, she asked him what kind of a day he had had, and how many souls he had got? \"Nothing went very well to-day,\" he answered, \"but I have laid hold of three soldiers, I have them safe.\" - \"Indeed! three soldiers, that\'s something like, but they may escape you yet.\" The Devil said mockingly, \"They are mine! I will set them a riddle, which they will never in this world be able to guess!\" - \"What riddle is that?\" she inquired. \"I will tell you. In the great North Sea lies a dead dog-fish, that shall be your roast meat, and the rib of a whale shall be your silver spoon, and a hollow old horse\'s hoof shall be your wine-glass.\" When the Devil had gone to bed, the old grandmother raised up the stone, and let out the soldier. \"Hast thou paid particular attention to everything?\" - \"Yes,\" said he, \"I know enough, and will contrive to save myself.\" Then he had to go back another way, through the window, secretly and with all speed to his companions. He told them how the Devil had been overreached by the old grandmother, and how he had learned the answer to the riddle from him. Then they were all joyous, and of good cheer, and took the whip and whipped so much gold for themselves that it ran all over the ground. When the seven years had fully gone by, the Devil came with the book, showed the signatures, and said, \"I will take you with me to hell. There you shall have a meal! If you can guess what kind of roast meat you will have to eat, you shall be free and released from your bargain, and may keep the whip as well.\" Then the first soldier began and said, \"In the great North Sea lies a dead dog-fish, that no doubt is the roast meat.\" The Devil was angry, and began to mutter, \"Hm! hm! hm!\" And asked the second, \"But what will your spoon be?\" - \"The rib of a whale, that is to be our silver spoon.\" The Devil made a wry face, again growled, \"Hm! hm! hm!\" and said to the third, \"And do you also know what your wine-glass is to be?\" - \"An old horse\'s hoof is to be our wineglass.\" Then the Devil flew away with a loud cry, and had no more power over them, but the three kept the whip, whipped as much money for themselves with it as they wanted, and lived happily to their end.</string>
    <string name="story309text">There was once a poor woman who gave birth to a little son; and as he came into the world with a caul on, it was predicted that in his fourteenth year he would have the King\'s daughter for his wife.\n\nIt happened that soon afterwards the King came into the village, and no one knew that he was the King, and when he asked the people what news there was, they answered, \"A child has just been born with a caul on; whatever any one so born undertakes turns out well. It is prophesied, too, that in his fourteenth year he will have the King\'s daughter for his wife.\"\n\nThe King, who had a bad heart, and was angry about the prophecy, went to the parents, and, seeming quite friendly, said, \"You poor people, let me have your child, and I will take care of it.\" At first they refused, but when the stranger offered them a large amount of gold for it, and they thought, \"It is a luck-child, and everything must turn out well for it,\" they at last consented, and gave him the child.\n\nThe King put it in a box and rode away with it until he came to a deep piece of water; then he threw the box into it and thought, \"I have freed my daughter from her unlooked-for suitor.\"\n\nThe box, however, did not sink, but floated like a boat, and not a drop of water made its way into it. And it floated to within two miles of the King\'s chief city, where there was a mill, and it came to a stand-still at the mill-dam. A miller\'s boy, who by good luck was standing there, noticed it and pulled it out with a hook, thinking that he had found a great treasure, but when he opened it there lay a pretty boy inside, quite fresh and lively. He took him to the miller and his wife, and as they had no children they were glad, and said, \"God has given him to us.\" They took great care of the foundling, and he grew up in all goodness.\n\nIt happened that once in a storm, the King went into the mill, and he asked the mill-folk if the tall youth was their son. \"No,\" answered they, \"he\'s a foundling. Fourteen years ago he floated down to the mill-dam in a box, and the mill-boy pulled him out of the water.\" Then the King knew that it was none other than the luck-child which he had thrown into the water, and he said, \"My good people, could not the youth take a letter to the Queen; I will give him two gold pieces as a reward?\" - \"Just as the King commands,\" answered they, and they told the boy to hold himself in readiness. Then the King wrote a letter to the Queen, wherein he said, \"As soon as the boy arrives with this letter, let him be killed and buried, and all must be done before I come home.\"\n\nThe boy set out with this letter; but he lost his way, and in the evening came to a large forest. In the darkness he saw a small light; he went towards it and reached a cottage. When he went in, an old woman was sitting by the fire quite alone. She started when she saw the boy, and said, \"Whence do you come, and whither are you going?\" - \"I come from the mill,\" he answered, \"and wish to go to the Queen, to whom I am taking a letter; but as I have lost my way in the forest I should like to stay here over night.\" - \"You poor boy,\" said the woman, \"you have come into a den of thieves, and when they come home they will kill you.\" - \"Let them come,\" said the boy, \"I am not afraid; but I am so tired that I cannot go any farther:\" and he stretched himself upon a bench and fell asleep.\n\nSoon afterwards the robbers came, and angrily asked what strange boy was lying there? \"Ah,\" said the old woman, \"it is an innocent child who has lost himself in the forest, and out of pity I have let him come in; he has to take a letter to the Queen.\" The robbers opened the letter and read it, and in it was written that the boy as soon as he arrived should be put to death. Then the hard-hearted robbers felt pity, and their leader tore up the letter and wrote another, saying, that as soon as the boy came, he should be married at once to the King\'s daughter. Then they let him lie quietly on the bench until the next morning, and when he awoke they gave him the letter, and showed him the right way.\n\nAnd the Queen, when she had received the letter and read it, did as was written in it, and had a splendid wedding-feast prepared, and the King\'s daughter was married to the luck-child, and as the youth was handsome and agreeable she lived with him in joy and contentment.\n\nAfter some time the King returned to his palace and saw that the prophecy was fulfilled, and the luck-child married to his daughter. \"How has that come to pass?\" said he; \"I gave quite another order in my letter.\" So the Queen gave him the letter, and said that he might see for himself what was written in it. The King read the letter and saw quite well that it had been exchanged for the other. He asked the youth what had become of the letter entrusted to him, and why he had brought another instead of it. \"I know nothing about it,\" answered he; \"it must have been changed in the night, when I slept in the forest.\"\n\nThe King said in a passion, \"You shall not have everything quite so much your own way; whosoever marries my daughter must fetch me from hell three golden hairs from the head of the devil; bring me what I want, and you shall keep my daughter.\" In this way the King hoped to be rid of him for ever. But the luck-child answered, \"I will fetch the golden hairs, I am not afraid of the Devil.\"\n\nThereupon he took leave of them and began his journey. The road led him to a large town, where the watchman by the gates asked him what his trade was, and what he knew. \"I know everything,\" answered the luck-child. \"Then you can do us a favour,\" said the watchman, \"if you will tell us why our market-fountain, which once flowed with wine has become dry, and no longer gives even water?\" - \"That you shall know,\" answered he; \"only wait until I come back.\" Then he went farther and came to another town, and there also the gatekeeper asked him what was his trade, and what he knew. \"I know everything,\" answered he. \"Then you can do us a favour and tell us why a tree in our town which once bore golden apples now does not even put forth leaves?\" - \"You shall know that,\" answered he; \"only wait until I come back.\" Then he went on and came to a wide river over which he must go. The ferryman asked him what his trade was, and what he knew. \"I know everything,\" answered he. \"Then you can do me a favour,\" said the ferryman, \"and tell me why I must always be rowing backwards and forwards, and am never set free?\" - \"You shall know that,\" answered he; \"only wait until I come back.\"\n\nWhen he had crossed the water he found the entrance to Hell. It was black and sooty within, and the Devil was not at home, but his grandmother was sitting in a large arm-chair. \"What do you want?\" said she to him, but she did not look so very wicked. \"I should like to have three golden hairs from the devil\'s head,\" answered he, \"else I cannot keep my wife.\" - \"That is a good deal to ask for,\" said she; \"if the devil comes home and finds you, it will cost you your life; but as I pity you, I will see if I cannot help you.\" She changed him into an ant and said, \"Creep into the folds of my dress, you will be safe there.\" - \"Yes,\" answered he, \"so far, so good; but there are three things besides that I want to know: why a fountain which once flowed with wine has become dry, and no longer gives even water; why a tree which once bore golden apples does not even put forth leaves; and why a ferry-man must always be going backwards and forwards, and is never set free?\" - \"Those are difficult questions,\" answered she, \"but only be silent and quiet and pay attention to what the devil says when I pull out the three golden hairs.\"\n\nAs the evening came on, the devil returned home. No sooner had he entered than he noticed that the air was not pure. \"I smell man\'s flesh,\" said he; \"all is not right here.\" Then he pried into every corner, and searched, but could not find anything. His grandmother scolded him. \"It has just been swept,\" said she, \"and everything put in order, and now you are upsetting it again; you have always got man\'s flesh in your nose. Sit down and eat your supper.\" When he had eaten and drunk he was tired, and laid his head in his grandmother\'s lap, and before long he was fast asleep, snoring and breathing heavily. Then the old woman took hold of a golden hair, pulled it out, and laid it down near her. \"Oh!\" cried the devil, \"what are you doing?\"\n\n\"I have had a bad dream,\" answered the grandmother, \"so I seized hold of your hair.\" - \"What did you dream then?\" said the devil. \"I dreamed that a fountain in a market-place from which wine once flowed was dried up, and not even water would flow out of it; what is the cause of it?\" - \"Oh, ho! if they did but know it,\" answered the devil; \"there is a toad sitting under a stone in the well; if they killed it, the wine would flow again.\"\n\nHe went to sleep again and snored until the windows shook. Then she pulled the second hair out. \"Ha! what are you doing?\" cried the devil angrily. \"Do not take it ill,\" said she, \"I did it in a dream.\" - \"What have you dreamt this time?\" asked he. \"I dreamt that in a certain kingdom there stood an apple-tree which had once borne golden apples, but now would not even bear leaves. What, think you, was the reason?\"\n\n\"Oh! if they did but know,\" answered the devil. \"A mouse is gnawing at the root; if they killed this they would have golden apples again, but if it gnaws much longer the tree will wither altogether. But leave me alone with your dreams: if you disturb me in my sleep again you will get a box on the ear.\" The grandmother spoke gently to him until he fell asleep again and snored. Then she took hold of the third golden hair and pulled it out. The devil jumped up, roared out, and would have treated her ill if she had not quieted him once more and said, \"Who can help bad dreams?\"\n\n\"What was the dream, then?\" asked he, and was quite curious. \"I dreamt of a ferry-man who complained that he must always ferry from one side to the other, and was never released. What is the cause of it?\" - \"Ah! the fool,\" answered the devil; \"when any one comes and wants to go across he must put the oar in his hand, and the other man will have to ferry and he will be free.\" As the grandmother had plucked out the three golden hairs, and the three questions were answered, she let the old serpent alone, and he slept until daybreak. When the devil had gone out again the old woman took the ant out of the folds of her dress, and gave the luck-child his human shape again.\n\n\"There are the three golden hairs for you,\" said she. \"What the Devil said to your three questions, I suppose you heard?\" - \"Yes,\" answered he, \"I heard, and will take care to remember.\" - \"You have what you want,\" said she, \"and now you can go your way.\" He thanked the old woman for helping him in his need, and left hell well content that everything had turned out so fortunately. When he came to the ferry-man he was expected to give the promised answer. \"Ferry me across first,\" said the luck-child, \"and then I will tell you how you can be set free,\" and when he reached the opposite shore he gave him the devil\'s advice: \"Next time any one comes, who wants to be ferried over, just put the oar in his hand.\"\n\nHe went on and came to the town wherein stood the unfruitful tree, and there too the watchman wanted an answer. So he told him what he had heard from the devil: \"Kill the mouse which is gnawing at its root, and it will again bear golden apples.\" Then the watchman thanked him, and gave him as a reward two asses laden with gold, which followed him. At last he came to the town whose well was dry. He told the watchman what the devil had said: \"A toad is in the well beneath a stone; you must find it and kill it, and the well will again give wine in plenty.\" The watchman thanked him, and also gave him two asses laden with gold.\n\nAt last the luck-child got home to his wife, who was heartily glad to see him again, and to hear how well he had prospered in everything. To the King he took what he had asked for, the devil\'s three golden hairs, and when the King saw the four asses laden with gold he was quite content, and said, \"Now all the conditions are fulfilled, and you can keep my daughter. But tell me, dear son-in-law, where did all that gold come from? this is tremendous wealth!\" - \"I was rowed across a river,\" answered he, \"and got it there; it lies on the shore instead of sand.\" - \"Can I too fetch some of it?\" said the King; and he was quite eager about it. \"As much as you like,\" answered he. \"There is a ferry-man on the river; let him ferry you over, and you can fill your sacks on the other side.\"\n\nThe greedy King set out in all haste, and when he came to the river he beckoned to the ferry-man to put him across. The ferry-man came and bade him get in, and when they got to the other shore he put the oar in his hand and sprang out. But from this time forth the King had to ferry, as a punishment for his sins. Perhaps he is ferrying still? If he is, it is because no one has taken the oar from him.</string>
    <string name="story310text">A disbanded soldier had nothing to live on, and did not know how to get on. So he went out into the forest and when he had walked for a short time, he met a little man who was, however, the Devil. The little man said to him, \"What ails you, you seem so very sorrowful?\" Then the soldier said, \"I am hungry, but have no money.\" The Devil said, \"If you will hire yourself to me, and be my serving-man, you shall have enough for all your life? You shall serve me for seven years, and after that you shall again be free. But one thing I must tell you, and that is, you must not wash, comb, or trim yourself, or cut your hair or nails, or wipe the water from your eyes.\" The soldier said, \"All right, if there is no help for it,\" and went off with the little man, who straightway led him down into hell. Then he told him what he had to do. He was to poke the fire under the kettles wherein the hell-broth was stewing, keep the house clean, drive all the sweepings behind the doors, and see that everything was in order, but if he once peeped into the kettles, it would go ill with him. The soldier said, \"Good, I will take care.\" And then the old Devil went out again on his wanderings, and the soldier entered upon his new duties, made the fire, and swept the dirt well behind the doors, just as he had been bidden. When the old Devil came back again, he looked to see if all had been done, appeared satisfied, and went forth a second time. The soldier now took a good look on every side; the kettles were standing all round hell with a mighty fire below them, and inside they were boiling and sputtering. He would have given anything to look inside them, if the Devil had not so particularly forbidden him: at last, he could no longer restrain himself, slightly raised the lid of the first kettle, and peeped in, and there he saw his former corporal shut in. \"Aha, old bird!\" said he, \"Do I meet you here? You once had me in your power, now I have you,\" and he quickly let the lid fall, poked the fire, and added a fresh log. After that, he went to the second kettle, raised its lid also a little, and peeped in; his former ensign was in that. \"Aha, old bird, so I find you here! You once had me in your power, now I have you.\" He closed the lid again, and fetched yet another log to make it really hot. Then he wanted to see who might be sitting up in the third kettle it was actually be but a general. \"Aha, old bird, do I meet you here? Once you had me in your power, now I have you.\" And he fetched the bellows and made hell-fire blaze right under him. So he did his work seven years in hell, did not wash, comb, or trim himself, or cut his hair or nails, or wash the water out of his eyes, and the seven years seemed so short to him that he thought he had only been half a year. Now when the time had fully gone by, the Devil came and said, \"Well Hans, what have you done?\" - \"I poked the fire under the kettles, and I have swept all the dirt well behind the doors.\" - \"But you have peeped into the kettles as well; it is lucky for you that you added fresh logs to them, or else your life would have been forfeited; now that your time is up, will you go home again?\" - \"Yes,\" said the soldier, \"I should very much like to see what my father is doing at home.\" The Devil said, \"In order that you may receive the wages you have earned, go and fill your knapsack full of the sweepings, and take it home with you. You must also go unwashed and uncombed, with long hair on your head and beard, and with uncut nails and dim eyes, and when you are asked whence you come, you must say, \'From hell,\' and when you are asked who you are, you are to say, \'The Devil\'s sooty brother, and my King as well.\'\" The soldier held his peace, and did as the Devil bade him, but he was not at all satisfied with his wages.\n\nThen as soon as he was up in the forest again, he took his knapsack from his back, to empty it, but on opening it, the sweepings had become pure gold. \"I should never have expected that,\" said he, and was well pleased, and entered the town. The landlord was standing in front of the inn, and when he saw the soldier approaching, he was terrified, because Hans looked so horrible, worse than a scare-crow. He called to him and asked, \"Whence comest thou?\" - \"From hell.\" - \"Who art thou?\" - \"The Devil\'s sooty brother, and my King as well.\" Then the host would not let him enter, but when Hans showed him the gold, he came and unlatched the door himself. Hans then ordered the best room and attendance, ate, and drank his fill, but neither washed nor combed himself as the Devil had bidden him, and at last lay down to sleep. But the knapsack full of gold remained before the eyes of the landlord, and left him no peace, and during the night he crept in and stole it away.\n\nNext morning, however, when Hans got up and wanted to pay the landlord and travel further, behold his knapsack was gone! But he soon composed himself and thought, \"Thou hast been unfortunate from no fault of thine own,\" and straightway went back again to hell, complained of his misfortune to the old Devil, and begged for his help. The Devil said, \"Seat yourself, I will wash, comb, and trim you, cut your hair and nails, and wash your eyes for you,\" and when he had done with him, he gave him the knapsack back again full of sweepings, and said, \"Go and tell the landlord that he must return you your money, or else I will come and fetch him, and he shall poke the fire in your place.\" Hans went up and said to the landlord, \"Thou hast stolen my money; if thou dost not return it, thou shalt go down to hell in my place, and wilt look as horrible as I.\" Then the landlord gave him the money, and more besides, only begging him to keep it secret, and Hans was now a rich man.\n\nHe set out on his way home to his father, bought himself a shabby smock-frock to wear, and strolled about making music, for he had learned to do that while he was with the Devil in hell. There was however, an old King in that country, before whom he had to play, and the King was so delighted with his playing, that he promised him his eldest daughter in marriage. But when she heard that she was to be married to a common fellow in a smock-frock, she said, \"Rather than do that, I would go into the deepest water.\" Then the King gave him the youngest, who was quite willing to do it to please her father, and thus the Devil\'s sooty brother got the King\'s daughter, and when the aged King died, the whole kingdom likewise.</string>
    <string name="story311text">I will tell you something. I saw two roasted fowls flying; they flew quickly and had their breasts turned to heaven and their backs to hell, and an anvil and a mill-stone swam across the Rhine prettily, slowly, and gently, and a frog sat on the ice at Whitsuntide and ate a ploughshare. Three fellows who wanted to catch a hare, went on crutches and stilts; one of them was deaf, the second blind, the third dumb, and the fourth could not stir a step. Do you want to know how it was done? First, the blind man saw the hare running across the field, the dumb one called to the lame one, and the lame one seized it by the neck.\nThere were certain men who wished to sail on dry land, and they set their sails in the wind, and sailed away over great fields. Then they sailed over a high mountain, and there they were miserably drowned. A crab was chasing a hare which was running away at full speed, and high up on the roof lay a cow which had climbed up there. In that country the flies are as big as the goats are here. Open the window, that the lies may fly out.</string>
    <string name="story312text">There was once on a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two thalers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how daintily he ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and he would willingly have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length inquired if he too could not be a doctor. \"Oh, yes,\" said the doctor, \"that is soon managed.\" - \"What must I do?\" asked the peasant. \"In the first place buy thyself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on the frontispiece: in the second, turn thy cart and thy two oxen into money, and get thyself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for thyself with the words, \"I am Doctor Knowall,\" and have that nailed up above thy house-door.\" The peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had the horses put in his carriage, drove out to the village, and asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall? Yes, he was, he said. Then he was to go with him and bring back the stolen money. \"Oh, yes, but Grethe, my wife, must go too.\" The lord was willing and let both of them have a seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came to the nobleman\'s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to sit down and eat. \"Yes, but my wife, Grethe, too,\" said he, and he seated himself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said, \"Grethe, that was the first,\" meaning that was the servant who brought the first dish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say, \"That is the first thief,\" and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said to his comrade outside, \"The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he said I was the first.\" The second did not want to go in at all, but was forced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife, and said, \"Grethe, that is the second.\" This servant was just as much alarmed, and he got out. The third did not fare better, for the peasant again said, \"Grethe, that is the third.\" The fourth had to carry in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and cried, \"Ah, poor Crabb.\" When the lord heard that, he cried, \"There! he knows it, he knows who has the money!\"\n\nOn this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall, sat down to the table, and said, \"My lord, now will I search in my book where the gold is hidden.\" The fifth servant, however, crept into the stove to hear if the doctor knew still more. The Doctor, however, sat still and opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and looked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said, \"I know you are there, so you had better show yourself.\" Then the fellow in the stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out, crying, \"That man knows everything!\" Then Dr. Knowall showed the count where the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.</string>
    <string name="story313text">A shepherd\'s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood. On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, \"Why are you so sad, my friend?\" - \"Because,\" said the dog, \"I am very very hungry, and have nothing to eat.\" - \"If that be all,\" answered the sparrow, \"come with me into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.\" So on they went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher\'s shop, the sparrow said to the dog, \"Stand there a little while till I peck you down a piece of meat.\" So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf, till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. \"Well,\" said the sparrow, \"you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.\" When the dog had eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, \"Well, my good friend, have you had enough now?\" - \"I have had plenty of meat,\" answered he, \"but I should like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.\" - \"Come with me then,\" said the sparrow, \"and you shall soon have that too.\" So she took him to a baker\'s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. \"Yes,\" said he; \"and now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.\"\n\nSo they both went out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone far before the dog said, \"I am very much tired, I should like to take a nap.\" - \"Very well,\" answered the sparrow, \"do so, and in the meantime I will perch upon that bush.\" So the dog stretched himself out on the road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called out, \"Stop! Stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.\" But the carter, grumbling to himself, \"You make it the worse for me, indeed! What can you do?\" cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. \"There,\" cried the sparrow, \"thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.\" - \"Do your worst, and welcome,\" said the brute, \"what harm can you do me?\" and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and than all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty. \"What an unlucky wretch I am!\" cried he. \"Not wretch enough yet!\" said the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this, he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse\'s head with such force, that he fell down dead. \"Unlucky wretch that I am!\" cried he. \"Not wretch enough yet!\" said the sparrow. And as the carter went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, \"Miserable wretch that I am!\" But the sparrow answered, \"Not wretch enough yet!\" and perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the spot. \"Unlucky wretch that I am!\" said he. \"Not wretch enough yet!\" said the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his third horse as he done the other two. \"Alas! miserable wretch that I am!\" cried he. \"Not wretch enough yet!\" answered the sparrow as she flew away; \"now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.\"\n\nThe carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home overflowing with rage and vexation. \"Alas!\" said he to his wife, \"what ill luck has befallen me! my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three dead.\" - \"Alas! husband,\" replied she, \"and a wicked bird has come into the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it up at such a rate!\" Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the midst of them. \"Unlucky wretch that I am!\" cried the carter; for he saw that the corn was almost all gone. \"Not wretch enough yet!\" said the sparrow; \"thy cruelty shall cost thee they life yet!\" and away she flew.\n\nThe carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat on the outside of the window, and cried \"Carter! Thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life!\" With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet, and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window- seat, and cried, \"Carter! It shall cost thee thy life!\" Then he became mad and blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture, glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the wife said, \"Shall I kill her at once?\" - \"No,\" cried he, \"that is letting her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat her.\" But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck and cried, \"Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!\" With that he could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, \"Wife, strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.\" And the wife struck; but she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.</string>
    <string name="story315text">There was once a young huntsman who went into the forest to lie in wait. He had a fresh and joyous heart, and as he was going thither, whistling upon a leaf, an ugly old crone came up, who spoke to him and said, \"Good-day, dear huntsman, truly you are merry and contented, but I am suffering from hunger and thirst, do give me an alms.\" The huntsman had compassion on the poor old creature, felt in his pocket, and gave her what he could afford. He was then about to go further, but the old woman stopped him and said, \"Listen, dear huntsman, to what I tell you; I will make you a present in return for your kindness. Go on your way now, but in a little while you will come to a tree, whereon nine birds are sitting which have a cloak in their claws, and are plucking at it; take your gun and shoot into the midst of them, they will let the cloak fall down to you, but one of the birds will be hurt, and will drop down dead. Carry away the cloak, it is a wishing-cloak; when you throw it over your shoulders, you only have to wish to be in a certain place, and you will be there in the twinkling of an eye. Take out the heart of the dead bird and swallow it whole, and every morning early, when you get up, you will find a gold piece under your pillow.\" The huntsman thanked the wise woman, and thought to himself, \"Those are fine things that she has promised me, if all does but come true.\" And verily when he had walked about a hundred paces, he heard in the branches above him such a screaming and twittering that he looked up and saw there a crowd of birds who were tearing a piece of cloth about with their beaks and claws, and tugging and fighting as if each wanted to have it all to himself. \"Well,\" said the huntsman, \"this is wonderful, it has really come to pass just as the old wife foretold!\" and he took the gun from his shoulder, aimed and fired right into the midst of them, so that the feathers flew about. The birds instantly took to flight with loud outcries, but one dropped down dead, and the cloak fell at the same time. Then the huntsman did as the old woman had directed him, cut open the bird, sought the heart, swallowed it down, and took the cloak home with him.\nNext morning, when he awoke, the promise occurred to him, and he wished to see if it also had been fulfilled. When he lifted up the pillow, the gold piece shone in his eyes, and next day he found another, and so it went on, every time he got up. He gathered together a heap of gold, but at last he thought, \"Of what use is all my gold to me if I stay at home? I will go forth and see the world.\"\n\nHe then took leave of his parents, buckled on his huntsman\'s pouch and gun, and went out into the world. It came to pass, that one day he travelled through a dense forest, and when he came to the end of it, in the plain before him stood a fine castle. An old woman was standing with a wonderfully beautiful maiden, looking out of one of the windows. The old woman, however, was a witch and said to the maiden, \"There comes one out of the forest, who has a wonderful treasure in his body, we must filch it from him, my dear daughter, it is more suitable for us than for him. He has a bird\'s heart about him, by means of which a gold piece lies every morning under his pillow.\" She told her what she was to do to get it, and what part she had to play, and finally threatened her, and said with angry eyes, \"And if you do not attend to what I say, it will be the worse for you.\" Now when the huntsman came nearer he descried the maiden, and said to himself, \"I have travelled about for such a long time, I will take a rest for once, and enter that beautiful castle. I have certainly money enough.\" Nevertheless, the real reason was that he had caught sight of the pretty girl.\n\nHe entered the house, and was well received and courteously entertained. Before long he was so much in love with the young witch that he no longer thought of anything else, and only saw things as she saw them, and did what she desired. The old woman then said, \"Now we must have the bird\'s heart, he will never miss it.\" She prepared a drink, and when it was ready, poured it into a cup and gave it to the maiden, who was to present it to the huntsman. She did so, saying, \"Now, my dearest, drink to me.\" So he took the cup, and when he had swallowed the draught, he brought up the heart of the bird. The girl had to take it away secretly and swallow it herself, for the old woman would have it so. Thenceforward he found no more gold under his pillow, but it lay instead under that of the maiden, from whence the old woman fetched it away every morning; but he was so much in love and so befooled, that he thought of nothing else but of passing his time with the girl.\n\nThen the old witch said, \"We have the bird\'s heart, but we must also take the wishing-cloak away from him.\" The girl answered, \"We will leave him that, he has lost his wealth.\" The old woman was angry and said, \"Such a mantle is a wonderful thing, and is seldom to be found in this world. I must and will have it!\" She gave the girl several blows, and said that if she did not obey, it should fare ill with her. So she did the old woman\'s bidding, placed herself at the window and looked on the distant country, as if she were very sorrowful. The huntsman asked, \"Why dost thou stand there so sorrowfully?\" - \"Ah, my beloved,\" was her answer, \"over yonder lies the Garnet Mountain, where the precious stones grow. I long for them so much that when I think of them, I feel quite sad, but who can get them? Only the birds; they fly and can reach them, but a man never.\" - \"Hast thou nothing else to complain of?\" said the huntsman. \"I will soon remove that burden from thy heart.\" With that he drew her under his mantle, wished himself on the Garnet Mountain, and in the twinkling of an eye they were sitting on it together. Precious stones were glistening on every side so that it was a joy to see them, and together they gathered the finest and costliest of them. Now, the old woman had, through her sorceries, contrived that the eyes of the huntsman should become heavy. He said to the maiden, \"We will sit down and rest awhile, I am so tired that I can no longer stand on my feet.\" Then they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap, and fell asleep. When he was asleep, she unfastened the mantle from his shoulders, and wrapped herself in it, picked up the garnets and stones, and wished herself back at home with them.\n\nBut when the huntsman had had his sleep out and awoke, and perceived that his sweetheart had betrayed him, and left him alone on the wild mountain, he said, \"Oh, what treachery there is in the world!\" and sat down there in care and sorrow, not knowing what to do. But the mountain belonged to some wild and monstrous giants who dwelt thereon and lived their lives there, and he had not sat long before he saw three of them coming towards him, so he lay down as if he were sunk in a deep sleep. Then the giants came up, and the first kicked him with his foot and said, \"What sort of an earth-worm is lying curled up here? The second said, \"Step upon him and kill him.\" But the third said, \"That would indeed be worth your while; just let him live, he cannot remain here; and when he climbs higher, toward the summit of the mountain, the clouds will lay hold of him and bear him away.\" So saying they passed by. But the huntsman had paid heed to their words, and as soon as they were gone, he rose and climbed up to the summit of the mountain, and when he had sat there a while, a cloud floated towards him, caught him up, carried him away, and travelled about for a long time in the heavens. Then it sank lower, and let itself down on a great cabbage-garden, girt round by walls, so that he came softly to the ground on cabbages and vegetables.\n\nThen the huntsman looked about him and said, \"If I had but something to eat! I am so hungry, and my hunger will increase in course of time; but I see here neither apples nor pears, nor any other sort of fruit, everywhere nothing but cabbages,\" but at length he thought, \"At a pinch I can eat some of the leaves, they do not taste particularly good, but they will refresh me.\" With that he picked himself out a fine head of cabbage, and ate it, but scarcely had he swallowed a couple of mouthfuls than he felt very strange and quite different.\n\nFour legs grew on him, a large head and two thick ears, and he saw with horror that he was changed into an ass. Still as his hunger increased every minute, and as the juicy leaves were suitable to his present nature, he went on eating with great zest. At last he arrived at a different kind of cabbage, but as soon as he had swallowed it, he again felt a change, and reassumed his former human shape.\n\nThen the huntsman lay down and slept off his fatigue. When he awoke next morning, he broke off one head of the bad cabbages and another of the good ones, and thought to himself, \"This shall help me to get my own again and punish treachery.\" Then he took the cabbages with him, climbed over the wall, and went forth to seek for the castle of his sweetheart. After wandering about for a couple of days he was lucky enough to find it again. He dyed his face brown, so that his own mother would not have known him; and begged for shelter: \"I am so tired,\" said he, \"that I can go no further.\" The witch asked, \"Who are you, countryman, and what is your business?\" - \"I am a King\'s messenger, and was sent out to seek the most delicious salad which grows beneath the sun. I have even been so fortunate as to find it, and am carrying it about with me; but the heat of the sun is so intense that the delicate cabbage threatens to wither, and I do not know if I can carry it any further.\"\n\nWhen the old woman heard of the exquisite salad, she was greedy, and said, \"Dear countryman, let me just taste this wonderful salad.\" - \"Why not?\" answered he, \"I have brought two heads with me, and will give you one of them,\" and he opened his pouch and handed her the bad cabbage. The witch suspected nothing amiss, and her mouth watered so for this new dish that she herself went into the kitchen and dressed it. When it was prepared she could not wait until it was set on the table, but took a couple of leaves at once, and put them in her mouth, but hardly had she swallowed them than she was deprived of her human shape, and she ran out into the courtyard in the form of an ass. Presently the maid-servant entered the kitchen, saw the salad standing there ready prepared, and was about to carry it up; but on the way, according to habit, she was seized by the desire to taste, and she ate a couple of leaves. Instantly the magic power showed itself, and she likewise became an ass and ran out to the old woman, and the dish of salad fell to the ground. Meantime the messenger sat beside the beautiful girl, and as no one came with the salad and she also was longing for it, she said, \"I don\'t know what has become of the salad.\" The huntsman thought, \"The salad must have already taken effect,\" and said, \"I will go to the kitchen and inquire about it.\" As he went down he saw the two asses running about in the courtyard; the salad, however, was lying on the ground. \"All right,\" said he, \"the two have taken their portion,\" and he picked up the other leaves, laid them on the dish, and carried them to the maiden. \"I bring you the delicate food myself,\" said he, \"in order that you may not have to wait longer.\" Then she ate of it, and was, like the others, immediately deprived of her human form, and ran out into the courtyard in the shape of an ass.\n\nAfter the huntsman had washed his face, so that the transformed ones could recognize him, he went down into the courtyard, and said, \"Now you shall receive the wages of your treachery,\" and bound them together, all three with one rope, and drove them along until he came to a mill. He knocked at the window, the miller put out his head, and asked what he wanted. \"I have three unmanageable beasts,\" answered he, \"which I don\'t want to keep any longer. Will you take them in, and give them food and stable room, and manage them as I tell you, and then I will pay you what you ask.\" The miller said, \"Why not? But how am I to manage them?\" The huntsman then said that he was to give three beatings and one meal daily to the old donkey, and that was the witch; one beating and three meals to the younger one, which was the servant-girl; and to the youngest, which was the maiden, no beatings and three meals, for he could not bring himself to have the maiden beaten. After that he went back into the castle, and found therein everything he needed.\n\nAfter a couple of days, the miller came and said he must inform him that the old ass which had received three beatings and only one meal daily was dead; \"the two others,\" he continued, \"are certainly not dead, and are fed three times daily, but they are so sad that they cannot last much longer.\" The huntsman was moved to pity, put away his anger, and told the miller to drive them back again to him. And when they came, he gave them some of the good salad, so that they became human again. The beautiful girl fell on her knees before him, and said, \"Ah, my beloved, forgive me for the evil I have done you; my mother drove me to it; it was done against my will, for I love you dearly. Your wishing-cloak hangs in a cupboard, and as for the bird\'s-heart I will take a vomiting potion.\" But he thought otherwise, and said, \"Keep it; it is all the same, for I will take thee for my true wife.\" So the wedding was celebrated, and they lived happily together until their death.</string>
    <string name="story316text">Once on a time there lived a King and a Queen, who were rich, and had everything they wanted, but no children. The Queen lamented over this day and night, and said, \"I am like a field on which nothing grows.\" At last God gave her her wish, but when the child came into the world, it did not look like a human child, but was a little donkey. When the mother saw that, her lamentations and outcries began in real earnest; she said she would far rather have had no child at all than have a donkey, and that they were to throw it into the water that the fishes might devour it. But the King said, \"No, since God has sent him he shall be my son and heir, and after my death sit on the royal throne, and wear the kingly crown.\" The donkey, therefore, was brought up and grew bigger, and his ears grew up beautifully high and straight. He was, however, of a merry disposition, jumped about, played and had especial pleasure in music, so that he went to a celebrated musician and said, \"Teach me thine art, that I may play the lute as well as thou dost.\" - \"Ah, dear little master,\" answered the musician, \"that would come very hard to you, your fingers are certainly not suited to it, and are far too big. I am afraid the strings would not last.\" No excuses were of any use. The donkey was determined to play the lute; he was persevering and industrious, and at last learnt to do it as well as the master himself. The young lordling once went out walking full of thought and came to a well, he looked into it and in the mirror-clear water saw his donkey\'s form. He was so distressed about it, that he went out into the wide world and only took with him one faithful companion. They travelled up and down, and at last they came into a kingdom where an old King reigned who had an only but wonderfully beautiful daughter. The donkey said, \"Here we will stay,\" knocked at the gate, and cried, \"A guest is without open, that he may enter.\" As, however, the gate was not opened, he sat down, took his lute and played it in the most delightful manner with his two fore-feet. Then the door-keeper opened his eyes most wonderfully wide, and ran to the King and said, \"Outside by the gate sits a young donkey which plays the lute as well as an experienced master!\" - \"Then let the musician come to me,\" said the King. When, however, a donkey came in, every one began to laugh at the lute-player. And now the donkey was asked to sit down and eat with the servants. He, however, was unwilling, and said, \"I am no common stable-ass, I am a noble one.\" Then they said, \"If that is what thou art, seat thyself with the men of war.\" - \"No,\" said he, \"I will sit by the King.\" The King smiled, and said good-humouredly, \"Yes, it shall be as thou wilt, little ass, come here to me.\" Then he asked, \"Little ass, how does my daughter please thee?\" The donkey turned his head towards her, looked at her, nodded and said, \"I like her above measure, I have never yet seen anyone so beautiful as she is.\" - \"Well, then, thou shalt sit next her too,\" said the King. \"That is exactly what I wish,\" said the donkey, and he placed himself by her side, ate and drank, and knew how to behave himself daintily and cleanly. When the noble beast had stayed a long time at the King\'s court, he thought, \"What good does all this do me, I shall still have to go home again?\" let his head hang sadly, and went to the King and asked for his dismissal. But the King had grown fond of him, and said, \"Little ass, what ails thee? Thou lookest as sour as a jug of vinegar, I will give thee what thou wantest. Dost thou want gold?\" - \"No,\" said the donkey, and shook his head. \"Dost thou want jewels and rich dress?\" - \"No.\" - \"Dost thou wish for half my kingdom?\" - \"Indeed, no.\" Then said the King, if I did but know what would make thee content. Wilt thou have my pretty daughter to wife?\" - \"Ah, yes,\" said the ass, \"I should indeed like her,\" and all at once he became quite merry and full of happiness, for that was exactly what he was wishing for. So a great and splendid wedding was held. In the evening, when the bride and bridegroom were led into their bed-room, the King wanted to know if the ass would behave well, and ordered a servant to hide himself there. When they were both within, the bridegroom bolted the door, looked around, and as he believed that they were quite alone, he suddenly threw off his ass\'s skin, and stood there in the form of a handsome royal youth. \"Now,\" said he, \"thou seest who I am, and seest also that I am not unworthy of thee.\" Then the bride was glad, and kissed him, and loved him dearly. When morning came, he jumped up, put his animal\'s skin on again, and no one could have guessed what kind of a form was hidden beneath it. Soon came the old King, \"Ah,\" cried he, \"is the little ass merry? But surely thou art sad?\" said he to his daughter, \"that thou hast not got a proper man for thy husband?\" - \"Oh, no, dear father, I love him as well as if he were the handsomest in the world, and I will keep him as long as I live.\" The King was surprised, but the servant who had concealed himself came and revealed everything to him. The King said, \"That cannot be true.\" - \"Then watch yourself the next night, and you will see it with your own eyes; and hark you, lord King, if you were to take his skin away and throw it in the fire, he would be forced to show himself in his true shape.\" - \"Thy advice is good,\" said the King, and at night when they were asleep, he stole in, and when he got to the bed he saw by the light of the moon a noble-looking youth lying there, and the skin lay stretched on the ground. So he took it away, and had a great fire lighted outside, and threw the skin into it, and remained by it himself until it was all burnt to ashes. As, however, he was anxious to know how the robbed man would behave himself, he stayed awake the whole night and watched. When the youth had slept his sleep out, he got up by the first light of morning, and wanted to put on the ass\'s skin, but it was not to be found. On this he was alarmed, and, full of grief and anxiety, said, \"Now I shall have to contrive to escape.\" But when he went out, there stood the King, who said, \"My son, whither away in such haste? what hast thou in mind? Stay here, thou art such a handsome man, thou shalt not go away from me. I will now give thee half my kingdom, and after my death thou shalt have the whole of it.\" - \"Then I hope that what begins so well may end well, and I will stay with you,\" said the youth. And the old man gave him half the kingdom, and in a year\'s time, when he died, the youth had the whole, and after the death of his father he had another kingdom as well, and lived in all magnificence.</string>
    <string name="story317text">In former times, when God himself still walked the earth, the fruitfulness of the soil was much greater than it is now; then the ears of corn did not bear fifty or sixty, but four or five hundred-fold. Then the corn grew from the bottom to the very top o f the stalk, and according to the length of the stalk was the length of the ear. Men however are so made, that when they are too well off they no longer value the blessings which come from God, but grow indifferent and careless. One day a woman was passing by a corn-field when her little child, who was running beside her, fell into a puddle, and dirtied her frock. On this the mother tore up a handful of the beautiful ears of corn, and cleaned the frock with them.\nWhen the Lord, who just then came by, saw that, he was angry, and said, \"Henceforth shall the stalks of corn bear no more ears; men are no longer worthy of heavenly gifts.\" The by-standers who heard this, were terrified, and fell on their knees and praye d that he would still leave something on the stalks, even if the people were undeserving of it, for the sake of the innocent birds which would otherwise have to starve. The Lord, who foresaw their suffering, had pity on them, and granted the request. So the ears were left as they now grow.</string>
    <string name="story318text">When God had created the world and was about to fix the length of each creature\'s life, the ass came and asked, \"Lord, how long shall I live?\" - \"Thirty years,\" replied God; \"does that content thee?\" - \"Ah, Lord,\" answered the ass, \"that is a long time. Think of my painful existence! To carry heavy burdens from morning to night, to drag sacks of corn to the mill, that others may eat bread, to be cheered and refreshed with nothing but blows and kicks. Relieve me of a portion of this long time.\" Then God had pity on him and relieved him of eighteen years. The ass went away comforted, and the dog appeared. \"How long wouldst thou like to live?\" said God to him. \"Thirty years are too many for the ass, but thou wilt be satisfied with that.\" - \"Lord,\" answered the dog, \"is that thy will? Consider how I shall have to run, my feet will never hold out so long, and when I have once lost my voice for barking, and my teeth for biting, what will be left for me to do but run from one corner to another and growl?\" God saw that he was right, and released him from twelve years of life. Then came the monkey. \"Thou wilt certainly live thirty years willingly?\" said the Lord to him. \"Thou hast no need to work as the ass and the dog have to do, and wilt always enjoy thyself.\" - \"Ah! Lord,\" he answered, \"it may seem as if that were the case, but it is quite different. When it rains porridge I have no spoon. I am always to play merry pranks, and make faces which force people to laugh, and if they give me an apple, and I bite into it, why it is sour! How often sadness hides itself behind mirth! I shall never be able to hold out for thirty years.\" God was gracious and took off ten.\nAt last man appeared, joyous, healthy and vigorous, and begged God to appoint his time for him. \"Thirty years shalt thou live,\" said the Lord. \"Is that enough for thee?\" - \"What a short time,\" cried man, \"when I have built my house and my fire burns on my own hearth; when I have planted trees which blossom and bear fruit, and am just intending to enjoy my life, I am to die! O Lord, lengthen my time.\" - \"I will add to it the ass\'s eighteen years,\" said God. \"That is not enough,\" replied the man. \"Thou shalt also have the dog\'s twelve years.\" - \"Still too little!\" - \"Well, then,\" said God, \"I will give thee the monkey\'s ten years also, but more thou shalt not have.\" The man went away, but was not satisfied.\n\nSo man lives seventy years. The first thirty are his human years, which are soon gone; then is he healthy, merry, works with pleasure, and is glad of his life. Then follow the ass\'s eighteen years, when one burden after another is laid on him, he has to carry the corn which feeds others, and blows and kicks are the reward of his faithful services. Then come the dog\'s twelve years, when he lies in the corner, and growls and has no longer any teeth to bite with, and when this time is over the monkey\'s ten years form the end. Then man is weak- headed and foolish, does silly things, and becomes the jest of the children.</string>
    <string name="story319text">FIRST STORY\n\nA shoemaker, by no fault of his own, had become so poor that at last he had nothing left but leather for one pair of shoes. So in the evening, he cut out the shoes which he wished to begin to make the next morning, and as he had a good conscience, he lay down quietly in his bed, commended himself to God, and fell asleep. In the morning, after he had said his prayers, and was just going to sit down to work, the two shoes stood quite finished on his table. He was astounded, and knew not what to say to it. He took the shoes in his hands to observe them closer, and they were so neatly made that there was not one bad stitch in them, just as if they were intended as a masterpiece. Soon after, a buyer came in, and as the shoes pleased him so well, he paid more for them than was customary, and, with the money, the shoemaker was able to purchase leather for two pairs of shoes. He cut them out at night, and next morning was about to set to work with fresh courage; but he had no need to do so, for, when he got up, they were already made, and buyers also were not wanting, who gave him money enough to buy leather for four pairs of shoes. The following morning, too, he found the four pairs made; and so it went on constantly, what he cut out in the evening was finished by the morning, so that he soon had his honest independence again, and at last became a wealthy man. Now it befell that one evening not long before Christmas, when the man had been cutting out, he said to his wife, before going to bed, \"What think you if we were to stay up to-night to see who it is that lends us this helping hand?\" The woman liked the idea, and lighted a candle, and then they hid themselves in a corner of the room, behind some clothes which were hanging up there, and watched. When it was midnight, two pretty little naked men came, sat down by the shoemaker\'s table, took all the work which was cut out before them and began to stitch, and sew, and hammer so skilfully and so quickly with their little fingers that the shoemaker could not turn away his eyes for astonishment. They did not stop until all was done, and stood finished on the table, and they ran quickly away.\n\nNext morning the woman said, \"The little men have made us rich, and we really must show that we are grateful for it. They run about so, and have nothing on, and must be cold. I\'ll tell thee what I\'ll do: I will make them little shirts, and coats, and vests, and trousers, and knit both of them a pair of stockings, and do thou, too, make them two little pairs of shoes.\" The man said, \"I shall be very glad to do it;\" and one night, when everything was ready, they laid their presents all together on the table instead of the cut-out work, and then concealed themselves to see how the little men would behave. At midnight they came bounding in, and wanted to get to work at once, but as they did not find any leather cut out, but only the pretty little articles of clothing, they were at first astonished, and then they showed intense delight. They dressed themselves with the greatest rapidity, putting the pretty clothes on, and singing,\n\n\"Now we are boys so fine to see,\nWhy should we longer cobblers be?\"\nThen they danced and skipped and leapt over chairs and benches. At last they danced out of doors. From that time forth they came no more, but as long as the shoemaker lived all went well with him, and all his undertakings prospered.\n\nSECOND STORY\n\nThere was once a poor servant-girl, who was industrious and cleanly, and swept the house every day, and emptied her sweepings on the great heap in front of the door. One morning when she was just going back to her work, she found a letter on this heap, and as she could not read, she put her broom in the corner, and took the letter to her master and mistress, and behold it was an invitation from the elves, who asked the girl to hold a child for them at its christening. The girl did not know what to do, but at length, after much persuasion, and as they told her that it was not right to refuse an invitation of this kind, she consented. Then three elves came and conducted her to a hollow mountain, where the little folks lived. Everything there was small, but more elegant and beautiful than can be described. The baby\'s mother lay in a bed of black ebony ornamented with pearls, the coverlids were embroidered with gold, the cradle was of ivory, the bath of gold. The girl stood as godmother, and then wanted to go home again, but the little elves urgently entreated her to stay three days with them. So she stayed, and passed the time in pleasure and gaiety, and the little folks did all they could to make her happy. At last she set out on her way home. Then first they filled her pockets quite full of money, and after that they led her out of the mountain again. When she got home, she wanted to begin her work, and took the broom, which was still standing in the corner, in her hand and began to sweep. Then some strangers came out of the house, who asked her who she was, and what business she had there? And she had not, as she thought, been three days with the little men in the mountains, but seven years, and in the meantime her former masters had died.\n\nTHIRD STORY\n\nA certain mother\'s child had been taken away out of its cradle by the elves, and a changeling with a large head and staring eyes, which would do nothing but eat and drink, laid in its place. In her trouble she went to her neighbour, and asked her advice. The neighbour said that she was to carry the changeling into the kitchen, set it down on the hearth, light a fire, and boil some water in two egg-shells, which would make the changeling laugh, and if he laughed, all would be over with him. The woman did everything that her neighbour bade her. When she put the egg-shells with water on the fire, the imp said, \"I am as old now as the Wester forest, but never yet have I seen any one boil anything in an egg-shell!\" And he began to laugh at it. Whilst he was laughing, suddenly came a host of little elves, who brought the right child, set it down on the hearth, and took the changeling away with them.</string>
    <string name="story320text">Once on a time lived a man and a woman who so long as they were rich had no children, but when they were poor they had a little boy. They could, however, find no godfather for him, so the man said he would just go to another place to see if he could get one there. As he went, a poor man met him, who asked him where he was going. He said he was going to see if he could get a godfather, that he was poor, so no one would stand as godfather for him. \"Oh,\" said the poor man, \"you are poor, and I am poor; I will be godfather for you, but I am so ill off I can give the child nothing. Go home and tell the nurse that she is to come to the church with the child.\"\nWhen they all got to the church together, the beggar was already there, and he gave the child the name of Ferdinand the Faithful.\n\nWhen he was going out of the church, the beggar said, \"Now go home, I can give you nothing, and you likewise ought to give me nothing.\" But he gave a key to the nurse, and told her when she got home she was to give it to the father, who was to take care of it until the child was fourteen years old, and then he was to go on the heath where there was a castle which the key would fit, and that all which was therein should belong to him. Now when the child was seven years old and had grown very big, he once went to play with some other boys, and each of them boasted that he had got more from his godfather than the other; but the child could say nothing, and was vexed, and went home and said to his father, \"Did I get nothing at all, then, from my godfather?\" - \"Oh, yes,\" said the father, \"thou hadst a key if there is a castle standing on the heath, just go to it and open it.\" Then the boy went thither, but no castle was to be seen, or heard of.\n\nAfter seven years more, when he was fourteen years old, he again went thither, and there stood the castle. When he had opened it, there was nothing within but a horse, a white one. Then the boy was so full of joy because he had a horse, that he mounted on it and galloped back to his father. \"Now I have a white horse, and I will travel,\" said he. So he set out, and as he was on his way, a pen was lying on the road. At first he thought he would pick it up, but then again he thought to himself, \"Thou shouldst leave it lying there; thou wilt easily find a pen where thou art going, if thou hast need of one.\" As he was thus riding away, a voice called after him, \"Ferdinand the Faithful, take it with thee.\" He looked around, but saw no one, then he went back again and picked it up. When he had ridden a little way farther, he passed by a lake, and a fish was lying on the bank, gasping and panting for breath, so he said, \"Wait, my dear fish, I will help thee get into the water,\" and he took hold of it by the tail, and threw it into the lake. Then the fish put its head out of the water and said, \"As thou hast helped me out of the mud I will give thee a flute; when thou art in any need, play on it, and then I will help thee, and if ever thou lettest anything fall in the water, just play and I will reach it out to thee.\" Then he rode away, and there came to him a man who asked him where he was going. \"Oh, to the next place.\" Then what his name was? \"Ferdinand the Faithful.\" - \"So! then we have got almost the same name, I am called Ferdinand the Unfaithful.\" And they both set out to the inn in the nearest place.\n\nNow it was unfortunate that Ferdinand the Unfaithful knew everything that the other had ever thought and everything he was about to do; he knew it by means of all kinds of wicked arts. There was, however, in the inn an honest girl, who had a bright face and behaved very prettily. She fell in love with Ferdinand the Faithful because he was a handsome man, and she asked him whither he was going. \"Oh, I am just travelling round about,\" said he. Then she said he ought to stay there, for the King of that country wanted an attendant or an outrider, and he ought to enter his service. He answered he could not very well go to any one like that and offer himself. Then said the maiden, \"Oh, but I will soon do that for you.\" And so she went straight to the King, and told him that she knew of an excellent servant for him. He was well pleased with that, and had Ferdinand the Faithful brought to him, and wanted to make him his servant. He, however, liked better to be an outrider, for where his horse was, there he also wanted to be, so the King made him an outrider. When Ferdinand the Unfaithful learnt that, he said to the girl, \"What! Dost thou help him and not me?\" - \"Oh,\" said the girl, \"I will help thee too.\" She thought, \"I must keep friends with that man, for he is not to be trusted.\" She went to the King, and offered him as a servant, and the King was willing.\n\nNow when the King met his lords in the morning, he always lamented and said, \"Oh, if I had but my love with me.\" Ferdinand the Unfaithful was, however, always hostile to Ferdinand the Faithful. So once, when the King was complaining thus, he said, \"You have the outrider, send him away to get her, and if he does not do it, his head must be struck off.\" Then the King sent for Ferdinand the Faithful, and told him that there was, in this place or in that place, a girl he loved, and that he was to bring her to him, and if he did not do it he should die.\n\nFerdinand the Faithful went into the stable to his white horse, and complained and lamented, \"Oh, what an unhappy man I am!\" Then someone behind him cried, \"Ferdinand the Faithful, why weepest thou?\" He looked round but saw no one, and went on lamenting; \"Oh, my dear little white horse, now must I leave thee; now must I die.\" Then some one cried once more, \"Ferdinand the Faithful, why weepest thou?\" Then for the first time he was aware that it was his little white horse who was putting that question. \"Dost thou speak, my little white horse; canst thou do that?\" And again, he said, \"I am to go to this place and to that, and am to bring the bride; canst thou tell me how I am to set about it?\" Then answered the little white horse, \"Go thou to the King, and say if he will give thou what thou must have, thou wilt get her for him. If he will give thee a ship full of meat, and a ship full of bread, it will succeed. Great giants dwell on the lake, and if thou takest no meat with thee for them, they will tear thee to pieces, and there are the large birds which would pick the eyes out of thy head if thou hadst no bread for them.\" Then the King made all the butchers in the land kill, and all the bakers bake, that the ships might be filled. When they were full, the little white horse said to Ferdinand the Faithful, \"Now mount me, and go with me into the ship, and then when the giants come, say,\n\n\n\"Peace, peace, my dear little giants,\nI have had thought of ye,\nSomething I have brought for ye;\"\nand when the birds come, thou shalt again say,\n\n\"Peace, peace, my dear little birds,\nI have had thought of ye,\nSomething I have brought for ye;\"\nthen they will do nothing to thee, and when thou comest to the castle, the giants will help thee. Then go up to the castle, and take a couple of giants with thee. There the princess lies sleeping; thou must, however, not awaken her, but the giants must lift her up, and carry her in her bed to the ship.\" And now everything took place as the little white horse had said, and Ferdinand the Faithful gave the giants and the birds what he had brought with him for them, and that made the giants willing, and they carried the princess in her bed to the King. And when she came to the King, she said she could not live, she must have her writings, they had been left in her castle. Then by the instigation of Ferdinand the Unfaithful, Ferdinand the Faithful was called, and the King told him he must fetch the writings from the castle, or he should die. Then he went once more into the stable, and bemoaned himself and said, \"Oh, my dear little white horse, now I am to go away again, how am I to do it?\" Then the little white horse said he was just to load the ships full again. So it happened again as it had happened before, and the giants and the birds were satisfied, and made gentle by the meat. When they came to the castle, the white horse told Ferdinand the Faithful that he must go in, and that on the table in the princess\'s bed-room lay the writings. And Ferdinand the Faithful went in, and fetched them. When they were on the lake, he let his pen fall into the water; then said the white horse, \"Now I cannot help thee at all.\" But he remembered his flute, and began to play on it, and the fish came with the pen in its mouth, and gave it to him. So he took the writings to the castle, where the wedding was celebrated.\nThe Queen, however, did not love the King because he had no nose, but she would have much liked to love Ferdinand the Faithful. Once, therefore, when all the lords of the court were together, the Queen said she could do feats of magic, that she could cut off any one\'s head and put it on again, and that one of them ought just to try it. But none of them would be the first, so Ferdinand the Faithful, again at the instigation of Ferdinand the Unfaithful, undertook it and she hewed off his head, and put it on again for him, and it healed together directly, so that it looked as if he had a red thread round his throat. Then the King said to her, \"My child, and where hast thou learnt that?\" - \"Yes,\" she said, \"I understand the art; shall I just try it on thee also?\" - \"Oh, yes,\" said he. But she cut off his head, and did not put it on again; but pretended that she could not get it on, and that it would not keep fixed. Then the King was buried, but she married Ferdinand the Faithful.\n\nHe, however, always rode on his white horse, and once when he was seated on it, it told him that he was to go on to the heath which he knew, and gallop three times round it. And when he had done that, the white horse stood up on its hind legs, and was changed into a King\'s son.</string>
    <string name="story321text">There was once a fisherman and his wife who lived together in a hovel by the sea-shore, and the fisherman went out every day with his hook and line to catch fish, and he angled and angled.\n\nOne day he was sitting with his rod and looking into the clear water, and he sat and sat.\n\nAt last down went the line to the bottom of the water, and when he drew it up he found a great flounder on the hook. And the flounder said to him, \"Fisherman, listen to me; let me go, I am not a real fish but an enchanted prince. What good shall I be to you if you land me? I shall not taste well; so put me back into the water again, and let me swim away.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the fisherman, \"no need of so many words about the matter, as you can speak I had much rather let you swim away.\"\nThen he put him back into the clear water, and the flounder sank to the bottom, leaving a long streak of blood behind him. Then the fisherman got up and went home to his wife in their hovel.\n\"Well, husband,\" said the wife, \"have you caught nothing to-day?\"\n\"No,\" said the man \"that is, I did catch a flounder, but as he said he was an enchanted prince, I let him go again.\"\n\"Then, did you wish for nothing?\"said the wife.\n\"No,\" said the man; \"what should I wish for?\"\n\"Oh dear!\" said the wife; \"and it is so dreadful always to live in this evil-smelling hovel j you might as well have wished for a little cottage; go again and call him; tell him we want a little cottage, I daresay he will give it us; go, and be quick.\"\nAnd when he went back, the sea was green and yellow, and not nearly so clear. So he stood and said,\n\"O man, O man!-if man you be, Or flounder, flounder, in the sea- Such a tiresome wife I\'ve got, For she wants what I do not.\"\nThen the flounder came swimming up, and said,\n\"Now then, what does she want?\"\n\"Oh,\" said the man, \"you know when I caught you my wife says I ought to have wished for something. She does not want to live any longer in the hovel, and would rather have a cottage.\n\"Go home with you,\" said the flounder, \"she has it already.\"\nSo the man went home, and found, instead of the hovel, a little cottage, and his wife was sitting on a bench before the door. And she took him by the hand, and said to him,\n\"Come in and see if this is not a great improvement.\"\nSo they went in, and there was a little house-place and a beautiful little bedroom, a kitchen and larder, with all sorts of furniture, and iron and brass ware of the very best. And at the back was a little yard with fowls and ducks, and a little garden full of green vegetables and fruit.\n\"Look,\" said the wife, \"is not that nice?\"\n\"Yes,\" said the man, \"if this can only last we shall be very well contented.\"\n\"We will see about that,\" said the wife. And after a meal they went to bed.\nSo all went well for a week or fortnight, when the wife said,\n\"Look here, husband, the cottage is really too confined, and the yard and garden are so small; I think the flounder had better get us a larger house; I should like very much to live in a large stone castle; so go to your fish and he will send us a castle.\"\n\"0 my dear wife,\" said the man, \"the cottage is good enough; what do we want a castle for?\"\n\"We want one,\" said the wife; \"go along with you; the flounder can give us one.\"\n\"Now, wife,\" said the man, \"the flounder gave us the cottage; I do not like to go to him again, he may be angry.\"\n\"Go along,\" said the wife, \"he might just as well give us it as not; do as I say!\"\nThe man felt very reluctant and unwilling; and he said to himself,\n\"It is not the right thing to do;\" nevertheless he went.\nSo when he came to the seaside, the water was purple and dark blue and grey and thick, and not green and yellow as before. And he stood and said,\n\"O man, O man!-if man you be, Or flounder, flounder, in the sea- Such a tiresome wife I\'ve got, For she wants what I do not.\"\n\"Now then, what does she want?\"said the flounder.\n\"Oh,\" said the man, half frightened, \"she wants to live in a large stone castle.\"\n\"Go home with you, she is already standing before the door,\" said the flounder.\nThen the man went home, as he supposed, but when he got there, there stood in the place of the cottage a great castle of stone, and his wife was standing on the steps, about to go in; so she took him by the hand, and said,\n\"Let us enter.\"\nWith that he went in with her, and in the castle was a great hall with a marble- pavement, and there were a great many servants, who led them through large doors, and the passages were decked with tapestry, and the rooms with golden chairs and tables, and crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling; and all the rooms had carpets. And the tables were covered with eatables and the best wine for any one who wanted them. And at the back of the house was a great stable-yard for horses and cattle, and carriages of the finest; besides, there was a splendid large garden, with the most beautiful flowers and fine fruit trees, and a pleasance full half a mile long, with deer and oxen and sheep, and everything that heart could wish for.\n\"There! \"said the wife, \"is not this beautiful?\"\n\"Oh yes,\" said the man, \"if it will only last we can live in this fine castle and be very well contented.\"\n\"We will see about that,\" said the wife, \"in the meanwhile we will sleep upon it.\" With that they went to bed.\nThe next morning the wife was awake first, just at the break of day, and she looked out and saw from her bed the beautiful country lying all round. The man took no notice of it, so she poked him in the side with her elbow, and said,\n\"Husband, get up and just look out of the window. Look, just think if we could be king over all this country . Just go to your fish and tell him we should like to be king.\"\n\"Now, wife,\" said the man, \"what should we be kings for? I don\'t want to be king.\"\n\"Well,\" said the wife, \"if you don\'t want to be king, I will be king.\"\n\"Now, wife,\" said the man, \"what do you want to be king for? I could not ask him such a thing.\"\n\"Why not?\" said the wife, \"you must go directly all the same; I must be king.\"\nSo the man went, very much put out that his wife should want to be king.\n\"It is not the right thing to do-not at all the right thing,\" thought the man. He did not at all want to go, and yet he went all the same.\nAnd when he came to the sea the water was quite dark grey, and rushed far inland, and had an ill smell. And he stood and said,\n\'\' O man, O man!-if man you be, Or flounder, flounder, in the sea- Such a tiresome wife I\'ve got, For she wants what I do not.\"\n\"Now then, what does she want?\" said the fish. \"Oh dear!\"said the man, \"she wants to be king.\"\n\"Go home with you, she is so already,\" said the fish.\nSo the man went back, and as he came to the palace he saw it was very much larger, and had great towers and splendid gateways; the herald stood before the door, and a number of soldiers with kettle-drums and trumpets.\nAnd when he came inside everything was of marble and gold, and there were many curtains with great golden tassels. Then he went through the doors of the saloon to where the great throne-room was, and there was his wife sitting upon a throne of gold and diamonds, and she had a great golden crown on, and the sceptre in her hand was of pure gold and jewels, and on each side stood six pages in a row, each one a head shorter than the other. So the man went up to her and said,\n\"Well, wife, so now you are king!\"\n\"Yes,\" said the wife, \"now I am king.\"\nSo then he stood and looked at her, and when he had gazed at her for some time he said,\n\"Well, wife, this is fine for you to be king! now there is nothing more to wish for.\"\n\"O husband!\" said the wife, seeming quite restless, \"I am tired of this already. Go to your fish and tell him that now I am king I must be emperor.\"\n\"Now, wife,\" said the man, \"what do you want to be emperor for?\"\n\"Husband,\" said she, \"go and tell the fish I want to be emperor.!\'\n\"Oh dear!\" said the man, \"he could not do it-I cannot ask him such a thing. There is but one emperor at a time; the fish can\'t possibly make any one emperor-indeed he can\'t.\"\n\"Now, look here,\" said the wife, \"I am king, and you are only my husband, so will you go at once? Go along! for if he was able to make me king he is able to make me emperor; and I will and must be emperor, so go along!\"\nSo he was obliged to go; and as he went he felt very uncomfortable about it, and he thought to himself,\n\"It is not at all the right thing to do; to want to be emperor is really going too far; the flounder will soon be beginning to get tired of this.\"\nWith that he came to the sea, and the water was quite black and thick, and the foam flew, and the wind blew, and the man was terrified. But he stood and said,\n\"O man, O man!-if man you be, Or flounder, flounder, in the sea- Such a tiresome wife I\'ve got, For she wants what I do not.\"\n\"What is it now?\" said the fish.\n\"Oh dear! \"said the man, \"my wife wants to be emperor.\"\n\"Go home with you,\" said the fish, \"she is emperor already.\"\nSo the man went home, and found the castle adorned with polished marble and alabaster figures, and golden gates. The troops were being marshalled before the door, and they were blowing trumpets and beating drums and cymbals; and when he entered he saw barons and earls and dukes waiting about like servants; and the doors were of bright gold. And he saw his wife sitting upon a throne made of one entire piece of gold, and it was about two miles high; and she had a great golden crown on, which was about three yards high, set with brilliants and carbuncles; and in one hand she held the sceptre, and in the other the globe; and on both sides of her stood pages in two rows, all arranged according to their size, from the most enormous giant of two miles high to the tiniest dwarf of the size of my little finger; and before her stood earls and dukes in crowds. So the man went up to her and said,\n\"Well, wife, so now you are emperor.\"\n\"Yes,\" said she, \"now I am emperor.\"\nThen he went and sat down and had a good look at her, and then he said,\n\"Well now, wife, there is nothing left to be, now you are emperor.\"\n\"What are you talking about, husband?\" said she; \"I am emperor, and next I will be pope! so go and tell the fish so.\"\n\"Oh dear!\" said the man, \"what is it that you don\'t want? You can never become pope; there is but one pope in Christendom, and the fish can\'t possibly do it.\"\n\"Husband,\" said she, \"no more words about it; I must and will be pope; so go along to the fish.\"\n\"Now, wife,\" said the man, \"how can I ask him such a thing? it is too bad-it is asking a little too much; and, besides, he could not do it.\"\n\"What rubbish!\" said the wife; \'\' if he could make me emperor he can make me pope. Go along and ask him; I am emperor, and you are only my husband, so go you must.\"\nSo he went, feeling very frightened, and he shivered and shook, and his knees trembled; and there arose a great wind, and the clouds flew by, and it grew very dark, and the sea rose mountains high, and the ships were tossed about, and the sky was partly blue in the middle, but at the sides very dark and red, as in a great tempest. And he felt very desponding, and stood trembling and said,\n\"O man, O man!-if man you be, Or flounder, flounder, in the sea- Such a tiresome wife I\'ve got, For she wants what I do not.\"\n\"Well, what now?\" said the fish.\n\"Oh dear!\" said the man, \"she wants to be pope.\"\n\"Go home with you, she is pope already,\" said the fish.\nSo he went home, and he found himself before a great church, with palaces all round. He had to make his way through a crowd of people; and when he got inside he found the place lighted up with thousands and thousands of lights; and his wife was clothed in a golden garment, and sat upon a very high throne, and had three golden crowns on, all in the greatest priestly pomp; and on both sides of her there stood two rows of lights of all sizes-from the size of the longest tower to the smallest rushlight, and all the emperors and kings were kneeling before her and kissing her foot.\n\"Well, wife,\" said the man, and sat and stared at her, \"so you are pope.\"\n\"Yes,\" said she, \"now I am pope!\"\nAnd he went on gazing at her till he felt dazzled, as if he were sitting in the sun. And after a little time he said,\n\"Well, now, wife, what is there left to be, now you are pope?\"\nAnd she sat up very stiff and straight, and said nothing.\nAnd he said again, \"Well, wife, I hope you are contented at last with being pope; you can be nothing more.\"\n\"We will see about that,\" said the wife. With that they both went to bed; but she was as far as ever from being contented, and she could not get to sleep for thinking of what she should like to be next.\nThe husband, however, slept as fast as a top after his busy day; but the wife tossed and turned from side to side the whole night through, thinking all the while what she could be next, but nothing would occur to her; and when she saw the red dawn she slipped off the bed, and sat before the window to see the sun rise, and as it came up she said,\n\"Ah, I have it! what if I should make the sun and moon to rise-husband!\"she cried, and stuck her elbow in his ribs, \"wake up, and go to your fish, and tell him T want power over the sun and moon.\"\nThe man was so fast asleep that when he started up he fell out of bed. Then he shook himself together, and opened his eyes and said,\n\"Oh,-wife, what did you say?\"\n\"Husband,\" said she, \"if I cannot get the power of making the sun and moon rise when I want them, I shall never have another quiet hour. Go to the fish and tell him so.\"\n\"O wife!\" said the man, and fell on his knees to her, \"the fish can really not do that for you. I grant you he could make you emperor and pope; do be contented with that, I beg of you.\"\nAnd she became wild with impatience, and screamed out,\n\"I can wait no longer, go at once!\"\nAnd so off he went as well as he could for fright. And a dreadful storm arose, so that he could hardly keep his feet; and the houses and trees were blown down, and the mountains trembled, and rocks fell in the sea; the sky was quite black, and it thundered and lightened; and the waves, crowned with foam, ran mountains high. So he cried out, without being able to hear his own words,\n\"O man, O man!-if man you be, Or flounder, flounder, in the sea- Such a tiresome wife I\'ve got, For she wants what I do not.\"\n\"Well, what now?\" said the flounder.\n\"Oh dear!\" said the man, \"she wants to order about the sun and moon.\"\n\"Go home with you!\"said the flounder, \"you will find her in the old hovel.\"\nAnd there they are sitting to this very day.</string>
    <string name="story322text">There was once a wizard who used to take the form of a poor man, and went to houses and begged, and caught pretty girls. No one knew whither he carried them, for they were never seen more. One day he appeared before the door of a man who had three pretty daughters; he looked like a poor weak beggar, and carried a basket on his back, as if he meant to collect charitable gifts in it. He begged for a little food, and when the eldest daughter came out and was just reaching him a piece of bread, he did but touch her, and she was forced to jump into his basket. Thereupon he hurried away with long strides, and carried her away into a dark forest to his house, which stood in the midst of it. Everything in the house was magnificent; he gave her whatsoever she could possibly desire, and said: \"My darling, thou wilt certainly be happy with me, for thou hast everything thy heart can wish for.\" This lasted a few days, and then he said: \"I must journey forth, and leave thee alone for a short time; there are the keys of the house; thou mayst go everywhere and look at everything except into one room, which this little key here opens, and there I forbid thee to go on pain of death.\" He likewise gave her an egg and said: \"Preserve the egg carefully for me, and carry it continually about with thee, for a great misfortune would arise from the loss of it.\" She took the keys and the egg, and promised to obey him in everything. When he was gone, she went all round the house from the bottom to the top, and examined everything. The rooms shone with silver and gold, and she thought she had never seen such great splendour. At length she came to the forbidden door; she wished to pass it by, but curiosity let her have no rest. She examined the key, it looked just like any other; she put it in the keyhole and turned it a little, and the door sprang open. But what did she see when she went in? A great bloody basin stood in the middle of the room, and therein lay human beings, dead and hewn to pieces, and hard by was a block of wood, and a gleaming axe lay upon it. She was so terribly alarmed that the egg which she held in her hand fell into the basin. She got it out and washed the blood off, but in vain, it appeared again in a moment. She washed and scrubbed, but she could not get it out.\n\nIt was not long before the man came back from his journey, and the first things which he asked for were the key and the egg. She gave them to him, but she trembled as she did so, and he saw at once by the red spots that she had been in the bloody chamber. \"Since thou hast gone into the room against my will,\" said he, \"thou shalt go back into it against thine own. Thy life is ended.\" He threw her down, dragged her thither by her hair, cut her head off on the block, and hewed her in pieces so that her blood ran on the ground. Then he threw her into the basin with the rest.\n\n\"Now I will fetch myself the second,\" said the wizard, and again he went to the house in the shape of a poor man, and begged. Then the second daughter brought him a piece of bread; he caught her like the first, by simply touching her, and carried her away. She did not fare better than her sister. She allowed herself to be led away by her curiosity, opened the door of the bloody chamber, looked in, and had to atone for it with her life on the wizard\'s return. Then he went and brought the third sister, but she was clever and crafty. When he had given her the keys and the egg, and had left her, she first put the egg away with great care, and then she examined the house, and at last went into the forbidden room. Alas, what did she behold! Both her sisters lay there in the basin, cruelly murdered, and cut in pieces. But she began to gather their limbs together and put them in order, head, body, arms and legs. And when nothing further was wanting the limbs began to move and unite themselves together, and both the maidens opened their eyes and were once more alive. Then they rejoiced and kissed and caressed each other. On his arrival, the man at once demanded the keys and the egg, and as he could perceive no trace of any blood on it, he said: \"Thou hast stood the test, thou shalt be my bride.\" He now had no longer any power over her, and was forced to do whatsoever she desired. \"Oh, very well,\" said she, \"thou shalt first take a basketful of gold to my father and mother, and carry it thyself on thy back; in the meantime I will prepare for the wedding.\" Then she ran to her sisters, whom she had hidden in a little chamber, and said: \"The moment has come when I can save you. The wretch shall himself carry you home again, but as soon as you are at home send help to me.\" She put both of them in a basket and covered them quite over with gold, so that nothing of them was to be seen, then she called in the wizard and said to him: \"Now carry the basket away, but I shall look through my little window and watch to see if thou stoppest on the way to stand or to rest.\"\n\nThe wizard raised the basket on his back and went away with it, but it weighed him down so heavily that the perspiration streamed from his face. Then he sat down and wanted to rest awhile, but immediately one of the girls in the basket cried: \"I am looking through my little window, and I see that thou art resting. Wilt thou go on at once?\" He thought it was his bride who was calling that to him; and got up on his legs again. Once more he was going to sit down, but instantly she cried: \"I am looking through my little window, and I see that thou art resting. Wilt thou go on directly?\" And whenever he stood still, she cried this, and then he was forced to go onwards, until at last, groaning and out of breath, he took the basket with the gold and the two maidens into their parents\' house.\n\nAt home, however, the bride prepared the marriage-feast, and sent invitations to the friends of the wizard. Then she took a skull with grinning teeth, put some ornaments on it and a wreath of flowers, carried it upstairs to the garret-window, and let it look out from thence. When all was ready, she got into a barrel of honey, and then cut the feather-bed open and rolled herself in it, until she looked like a wondrous bird, and no one could recognize her. Then she went out of the house, and on her way she met some of the wedding-guests, who asked:\n\n\"O, Fitcher\'s bird, how com\'st thou here?\"\n\"I come from Fitcher\'s house quite near.\"\n\"And what may the young bride be doing?\"\n\"From cellar to garret she\'s swept all clean,\nAnd now from the window she\'s peeping, I ween.\"\n\nAt last she met the bridegroom, who was coming slowly back. He, like the others, asked:\n\n\"O, Fitcher\'s bird, how com\'st thou here?\"\n\"I come from Fitcher\'s house quite near.\"\n\"And what may the young bride be doing?\n\"From cellar to garret she\'s swept all clean,\nAnd now from the window she\'s peeping, I ween.\"\n\nThe bridegroom looked up, saw the decked-out skull, thought it was his bride, and nodded to her, greeting her kindly. But when he and his guests had all gone into the house, the brothers and kinsmen of the bride, who had been sent to rescue her, arrived. They locked all the doors of the house, that no one might escape, set fire to it, and the wizard and all his crew had to burn.</string>
    <string name="story323text">A countryman was once going out to plough with a pair of oxen. When he got to the field, both the animals\' horns began to grow, and went on growing, and when he wanted to go home they were so big that the oxen could not get through the gateway for them. By good luck a butcher came by just then, and he delivered them over to him, and made the bargain in this way, that he should take the butcher a measure of turnip-seed, and then the butcher was to count him out a Brabant thaler for every seed. I call that well sold! The peasant now went home, and carried the measure of turnip-seed to him on his back. On the way, however, he lost one seed out of the bag. The butcher paid him justly as agreed on, and if the peasant had not lost the seed, he would have had one thaler the more. In the meantime, when he went on his way back, the seed had grown into a tree which reached up to the sky. Then thought the peasant, \"As thou hast the chance, thou must just see what the angels are doing up there above, and for once have them before thine eyes.\" So he climbed up, and saw that the angels above were threshing oats, and he looked on. While he was thus watching them, he observed that the tree on which he was standing, was beginning to totter; he peeped down, and saw that someone was just going to cut it down. \"If I were to fall down from hence it would be a bad thing,\" thought he, and in his necessity he did not know how to save himself better than by taking the chaff of the oats which lay there in heaps, and twisting a rope of it. He likewise snatched a hoe and a flail which were lying about in heaven, and let himself down by the rope. But he came down on the earth exactly in the middle of a deep, deep hole. So it was a real piece of luck that he had brought the hoe, for he hoed himself a flight of steps with it, and mounted up, and took the flail with him as a token of his truth, so that no one could have any doubt of his story.\n</string>
    <string name="story324text">There was once a poor man who had four sons, and when they were grown up, he said to them, \"My dear children, you must now go out into the world, for I have nothing to give you, so set out, and go to some distance and learn a trade, and see how you can make your way.\" So the four brothers took their sticks, bade their father farewell, and went through the town-gate together. When they had travelled about for some time, they came to a cross-way which branched off in four different directions. Then said the eldest, \"Here we must separate, but on this day four years, we will meet each other again at this spot, and in the meantime we will seek our fortunes.\"\nThen each of them went his way, and the eldest met a man who asked him where he was going, and what he was intending to do? \"I want to learn a trade,\" he replied. Then the other said, \"Come with me, and be a thief.\" - \"No,\" he answered, \"that is no longer regarded as a reputable trade, and the end of it is that one has to swing on the gallows.\" - \"Oh,\" said the man, \"you need not be afraid of the gallows; I will only teach you to get such things as no other man could ever lay hold of, and no one will ever detect you.\" So he allowed himself to be talked into it, and while with the man became an accomplished thief, and so dexterous that nothing was safe from him, if he once desired to have it. The second brother met a man who put the same question to him what he wanted to learn in the world. \"I don\'t know yet,\" he replied. \"Then come with me, and be an astronomer; there is nothing better than that, for nothing is hid from you.\" He liked the idea, and became such a skillful astronomer that when he had learnt everything, and was about to travel onwards, his master gave him a telescope and said to him, \"With that you canst thou see whatsoever takes place either on earth or in heaven, and nothing can remain concealed from thee.\" A huntsman took the third brother into training, and gave him such excellent instruction in everything which related to huntsmanship, that he became an experienced hunter. When he went away, his master gave him a gun and said, \"It will never fail you; whatsoever you aim at, you are certain to hit.\" The youngest brother also met a man who spoke to him, and inquired what his intentions were. \"Would you not like to be a tailor?\" said he. \"Not that I know of,\" said the youth; \"sitting doubled up from morning till night, driving the needle and the goose backwards and forwards, is not to my taste.\" - \"Oh, but you are speaking in ignorance,\" answered the man; \"with me you would learn a very different kind of tailoring, which is respectable and proper, and for the most part very honorable.\" So he let himself be persuaded, and went with the man, and learnt his art from the very beginning. When they parted, the man gave the youth a needle, and said, \"With this you can sew together whatever is given you, whether it is as soft as an egg or as hard as steel; and it will all become one piece of stuff, so that no seam will be visible.\"\n\nWhen the appointed four years were over, the four brothers arrived at the same time at the cross-roads, embraced and kissed each other, and returned home to their father. \"So now,\" said he, quite delighted, \"the wind has blown you back again to me.\" They told him of all that had happened to them, and that each had learnt his own trade. Now they were sitting just in front of the house under a large tree, and the father said, \"I will put you all to the test, and see what you can do.\" Then he looked up and said to his second son, \"Between two branches up at the top of this tree, there is a chaffinch\'s nest, tell me how many eggs there are in it?\" The astronomer took his glass, looked up, and said, \"There are five.\" Then the father said to the eldest, \"Fetch the eggs down without disturbing the bird which is sitting hatching them.\" The skillful thief climbed up, and took the five eggs from beneath the bird, which never observed what he was doing, and remained quietly sitting where she was, and brought them down to his father. The father took them, and put one of them on each corner of the table, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, \"With one shot thou shalt shoot me the five eggs in two, through the middle.\" The huntsman aimed, and shot the eggs, all five as the father had desired, and that at one shot. He certainly must have had some of the powder for shooting round corners. \"Now it\'s your turn,\" said the father to the fourth son; \"you shall sew the eggs together again, and the young birds that are inside them as well, and you must do it so that they are not hurt by the shot.\" The tailor brought his needle, and sewed them as his father wished. When he had done this the thief had to climb up the tree again, and carry them to the nest, and put them back again under the bird without her being aware of it. The bird sat her full time, and after a few days the young ones crept out, and they had a red line round their necks where they had been sewn together by the tailor.\n\n\"Well,\" said the old man to his sons, \"I begin to think you are worth more than breen clover; you have used your time well, and learnt something good. I can\'t say which of you deserves the most praise. That will be proved if you have but an early opportunity of using your talents.\" Not long after this, there was a great uproar in the country, for the King\'s daughter was carried off by a dragon. The King was full of trouble about it, both by day and night, and caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever brought her back should have her to wife. The four brothers said to each other, \"This would be a fine opportunity for us to show what we can do!\" and resolved to go forth together and liberate the King\'s daughter. \"I will soon know where she is,\" said the astronomer, and looked through his telescope and said, \"I see her already, she is far away from here on a rock in the sea, and the dragon is beside her watching her.\" Then he went to the King, and asked for a ship for himself and his brothers, and sailed with them over the sea until they came to the rock. There the King\'s daughter was sitting, and the dragon was lying asleep on her lap. The huntsman said, \"I dare not fire, I should kill the beautiful maiden at the same time.\" - \"Then I will try my art,\" said the thief, and he crept thither and stole her away from under the dragon, so quietly and dexterously, that the monster never remarked it, but went on snoring. Full of joy, they hurried off with her on board ship, and steered out into the open sea; but the dragon, who when he awoke had found no princess there, followed them, and came snorting angrily through the air. Just as he was circling above the ship, and about to descend on it, the huntsman shouldered his gun, and shot him to the heart. The monster fell down dead, but was so large and powerful that his fall shattered the whole ship. Fortunately, however, they laid hold of a couple of planks, and swam about the wide sea. Then again they were in great peril, but the tailor, who was not idle, took his wondrous needle, and with a few stitches sewed the planks together, and they seated themselves upon them, and collected together all the fragments of the vessel. Then he sewed these so skilfully together, that in a very short time the ship was once more seaworthy, and they could go home again in safety.\n\nWhen the King once more saw his daughter, there were great rejoicings. He said to the four brothers, \"One of you shall have her to wife, but which of you it is to be you must settle among yourselves.\" Then a warm contest arose among them, for each of them preferred his own claim. The astronomer said, \"If I had not seen the princess, all your arts would have been useless, so she is mine.\" The thief said, \"What would have been the use of your seeing, if I had not got her away from the dragon? so she is mine.\" The huntsman said, \"You and the princess, and all of you, would have been torn to pieces by the dragon if my ball had not hit him, so she is mine.\" The tailor said, \"And if I, by my art, had not sewn the ship together again, you would all of you have been miserably drowned, so she is mine.\" Then the King uttered this saying, \"Each of you has an equal right, and as all of you cannot have the maiden, none of you shall have her, but I will give to each of you, as a reward, half a kingdom.\" The brothers were pleased with this decision, and said, \"It is better thus than that we should be at variance with each other.\" Then each of them received half a kingdom, and they lived with their father in the greatest happiness as long as it pleased God.</string>
    <string name="story325text">It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to herself, \"He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the world,\" she spoke to him in a friendly way. \"Good-day, dear Mr. Fox, how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting through this dear season?\" The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give any answer or not. At last he said, \"Oh, thou wretched beard-cleaner, thou piebald fool, thou hungry mouse-hunter, what canst thou be thinking of? Dost thou venture to ask how I am getting on? What hast thou learnt? How many arts dost thou understand?\" - \"I understand but one,\" replied the cat, modestly. \"What art is that?\" asked the fox. \"When the hounds are following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.\" - \"Is that all?\" said the fox. \"I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain a sackful of cunning. Thou makest me sorry for thee; come with me, I will teach thee how people get away from the hounds.\" Just then came a hunter with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down on top of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. \"Open your sack, Mr. Fox, open your sack,\" cried the cat to him, but the dogs had already seized him, and were holding him fast. \"Ah, Mr. Fox,\" cried the cat. \"You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.\"</string>
    <string name="story326text">A peasant had a faithful horse which had grown old and could do no more work, so his master would no longer give him anything to eat and said, \"I can certainly make no more use of thee, but still I mean well by thee; if thou provest thyself still strong enough to bring me a lion here, I will maintain thee, but now take thyself away out of my stable,\" and with that he chased him into the open country. The horse was sad, and went to the forest to seek a little protection there from the weather. Then the fox met him and said, \"Why dost thou hang thy head so, and go about all alone?\" - \"Alas,\" replied the horse, \"avarice and fidelity do not dwell together in one house. My master has forgotten what services I have performed for him for so many years, and because I can no longer plough well, he will give me no more food, and has driven me out.\" - \"Without giving thee a chance?\" asked the fox. \"The chance was a bad one. He said, if I were still strong enough to bring him a lion, he would keep me, but he well knows that I cannot do that.\" The fox said, \"I will help thee, just lay thyself down, stretch thyself out, as if thou wert dead, and do not stir.\" The horse did as the fox desired, and the fox went to the lion, who had his den not far off, and said, \"A dead horse is lying outside there, just come with me, thou canst have a rich meal.\" The lion went with him, and when they were both standing by the horse the fox said, \"After all, it is not very comfortable for thee here I tell thee what I will fasten it to thee by the tail, and then thou canst drag it into thy cave, and devour it in peace.\"\nThis advice pleased the lion: he lay down, and in order that the fox might tie the horse fast to him, he kept quite quiet. But the fox tied the lion\'s legs together with the horse\'s tail, and twisted and fastened all so well and so strongly that no strength could break it. When he had finished his work, he tapped the horse on the shoulder and said, \"Pull, white horse, pull.\" Then up sprang the horse at once, and drew the lion away with him. The lion began to roar so that all the birds in the forest flew out in terror, but the horse let him roar, and drew him and dragged him over the country to his master\'s door. When the master saw the lion, he was of a better mind, and said to the horse, \"Thou shalt stay with me and fare well,\" and he gave him plenty to eat until he died.\n</string>
    <string name="story327text">The fox once came to a meadow in which was a flock of fine fat geese, on which he smiled and said, \"I come in the nick of time, you are sitting together quite beautifully, so that I can eat you up one after the other.\" The geese cackled with terror, sprang up, and began to wail and beg piteously for their lives. But the fox would listen to nothing, and said, \"There is no mercy to be had! You must die.\" At length one of them took heart and said, \"If we poor geese are to yield up our vigorous young lives, show us the only possible favour and allow us one more prayer, that we may not die in our sins, and then we will place ourselves in a row, so that you can always pick yourself out the fattest.\" - \"Yes,\" said the fox, \"that is reasonable, and a pious request. Pray away, I will wait till you are done.\" Then the first began a good long prayer, for ever saying, \"Ga! Ga!\" and as she would make no end, the second did not wait until her turn came, but began also, \"Ga! Ga!\" The third and fourth followed her, and soon they were all cackling together.\n\nWhen they have done praying, the story shall be continued further, but at present they are still praying without stopping.\"</string>
    <string name="story328text">There was once a little girl who was obstinate and inquisitive, and when her parents told her to do anything, she did not obey them, so how could she fare well? One day she said to her parents, \"I have heard so much of Frau Trude, I will go to her some day. People say that everything about her does look so strange, and that there are such odd things in her house, that I have become quite curious!\" Her parents absolutely forbade her, and said, \"Frau Trude is a bad woman, who does wicked things, and if thou goest to her; thou art no longer our child.\" But the maiden did not let herself be turned aside by her parent\'s prohibition, and still went to Frau Trude. And when she got to her, Frau Trude said, \"Why art thou so pale?\" - \"Ah,\" she replied, and her whole body trembled, \"I have been so terrified at what I have seen.\" - \"What hast thou seen?\" - \"I saw a black man on your steps.\" - \"That was a collier.\" - \"Then I saw a green man.\" - \"That was a huntsman.\" - \"After that I saw a blood-red man.\" - \"That was a butcher.\" - \"Ah, Frau Trude, I was terrified; I looked through the window and saw not you, but, as I verily believe, the devil himself with a head of fire.\" - \"Oho!\" said she, \"then thou hast seen the witch in her proper costume. I have been waiting for thee, and wanting thee a long time already; thou shalt give me some light.\" Then she changed the girl into a block of wood, and threw it into the fire. And when it was in full blaze she sat down close to it, and warmed herself by it, and said, \"That shines bright for once in a way.\"\n</string>
    <string name="story329text">There was once on a time a man who was called Frederick and a woman called Catherine, who had married each other and lived together as young married folks. One day Frederick said, \"I will now go and plough, Catherine; when I come back, there must be some roast meat on the table for hunger, and a fresh draught for thirst.\" - \"Just go, Frederick,\" answered Kate, \"just go, I will have all ready for you.\" Therefore when dinner-time drew near she got a sausage out of the chimney, put it in the frying-pan, put some butter to it, and set it on the fire. The sausage began to fry and to hiss, Catherine stood beside it and held the handle of the pan, and had her own thoughts as she was doing it. Then it occurred to her, \"While the sausage is getting done thou couldst go into the cellar and draw beer.\" So she set the frying-pan safely on the fire, took a can, and went down into the cellar to draw beer. The beer ran into the can and Kate watched it, and then she thought, \"Oh, dear! The dog upstairs is not fastened up, it might get the sausage out of the pan. Well thought of.\" And in a trice she was up the cellar-steps again, but the Spitz had the sausage in its mouth already, and trailed it away on the ground. But Catherine, who was not idle, set out after it, and chased it a long way into the field; the dog, however, was swifter than Catherine and did not let the sausage journey easily, but skipped over the furrows with it. \"What\'s gone is gone!\" said Kate, and turned round, and as she had run till she was weary, she walked quietly and comfortably, and cooled herself. During this time the beer was still running out of the cask, for Kate had not turned the tap. And when the can was full and there was no other place for it, it ran into the cellar and did not stop until the whole cask was empty. As soon as Kate was on the steps she saw the mischance. \"Good gracious!\" she cried. \"What shall I do now to stop Frederick knowing it!\" She thought for a while, and at last she remembered that up in the garret was still standing a sack of the finest wheat flour from the last fair, and she would fetch that down and strew it over the beer. \"Yes,\" said she, \"he who saves a thing when he ought, has it afterwards when he needs it,\" and she climbed up to the garret and carried the sack below, and threw it straight down on the can of beer, which she knocked over, and Frederick\'s draught swam also in the cellar. \"It is all right,\" said Kate, \"where the one is the other ought to be also,\" and she strewed the meal over the whole cellar. When it was done she was heartily delighted with her work, and said, \"How clean and wholesome it does look here!\"\n\nAt mid-day home came Frederick: \"Now, wife, what have you ready for me?\" - \"Ah, Freddy,\" she answered, \"I was frying a sausage for you, but whilst I was drawing the beer to drink with it, the dog took it away out of the pan, and whilst I was running after the dog, all the beer ran out, and whilst I was drying up the beer with the flour, I knocked over the can as well, but be easy, the cellar is quite dry again.\" Said Frederick, \"Kate, Kate, you should not have done that! to let the sausage be carried off and the beer run out of the cask, and throw out all our flour into the bargain!\" - \"Indeed, Frederick, I did not know that, you should have told me.\"\n\nThe man thought, \"If my wife is like this, I must look after things more.\" Now he had got together a good number of thalers which he changed into gold, and said to Catherine, \"Look, these are counters for playing games; I will put them in a pot and bury them in the stable under the cow\'s manger, but mind you keep away from them, or it will be the worse for you.\" Said she, \"Oh, no, Frederick, I certainly will not go.\" And when Frederick was gone some pedlars came into the village who had cheap earthen-bowls and pots, and asked the young woman if there was nothing she wanted to bargain with them for? \"Oh, dear people,\" said Catherine, \"I have no money and can buy nothing, but if you have any use for yellow counters I will buy of you.\" - \"Yellow counters, why not? But just let us see them.\" - \"Then go into the stable and dig under the cow\'s manger, and you will find the yellow counters. I am not allowed to go there.\" The rogues went thither, dug and found pure gold. Then they laid hold of it, ran away, and left their pots and bowls behind in the house. Catherine though she must use her new things, and as she had no lack in the kitchen already without these, she knocked the bottom out of every pot, and set them all as ornaments on the paling which went round about the house. When Frederick came and saw the new decorations, he said, \"Catherine, what have you been about?\" - \"I have bought them, Frederick, for the counters which were under the cow\'s manger. I did not go there myself, the pedlars had to dig them out for themselves.\" - \"Ah, wife,\" said Frederick, \"what have you done? Those were not counters, but pure gold, and all our wealth; you should not have done that.\" - \"Indeed, Frederick,\" said she, \"I did not know that, you should have forewarned me.\"\n\nCatherine stood for a while and bethought to herself; then she said, \"Listen, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back again, we will run after the thieves.\" - \"Come, then,\" said Frederick, \"we will try it; but take with you some butter and cheese that we may have something to eat on the way.\" - \"Yes, Frederick, I will take them.\" They set out, and as Frederick was the better walker, Catherine followed him. \"It is to my advantage,\" thought she, \"when we turn back I shall be a little way in advance.\" Then she came to a hill where there were deep ruts on both sides of the road. \"There one can see,\" said Catherine, \"how they have torn and skinned and galled the poor earth, it will never be whole again as long as it lives,\" and in her heart\'s compassion she took her butter and smeared the ruts right and left, that they might not be so hurt by the wheels, and as she was thus bending down in her charity, one of the cheeses rolled out of her pocket down the hill. Said Catherine, \"I have made my way once up here, I will not go down again; another may run and fetch it back.\" So she took another cheese and rolled it down. But the cheeses did not come back, so she let a third run down, thinking. \"Perhaps they are waiting for company, and do not like to walk alone.\" As all three stayed away she said, \"I do not know what that can mean, but it may perhaps be that the third has not found the way, and has gone wrong, I will just send the fourth to call it.\" But the fourth did no better than the third. Then Catherine was angry, and threw down the fifth and sixth as well, and these were her last. She remained standing for some time watching for their coming, but when they still did not come, she said, \"Oh, you are good folks to send in search of death, you stay a fine long time away! Do you think I will wait any longer for you? I shall go my way, you may run after me; you have younger legs than I.\" Catherine went on and found Frederick, who was standing waiting for her because he wanted something to eat. \"Now just let us have what you have brought with you,\" said he. She gave him the dry bread. \"Where have you the butter and the cheeses?\" asked the man. \"Ah, Freddy,\" said Catherine, \"I smeared the cart-ruts with the butter and the cheeses will come soon; one ran away from me, so I sent the others after to call it.\" Said Frederick, \"You should not have done that, Catherine, to smear the butter on the road, and let the cheeses run down the hill!\" - \"Really, Frederick, you should have told me.\"\n\nThen they ate the dry bread together, and Frederick said, \"Catherine, did you make the house safe when you came away?\" - \"No, Frederick, you should have told me to do it before.\" - \"Then go home again, and make the house safe before we go any farther, and bring with you something else to eat. I will wait here for you.\" Catherine went back and thought, \"Frederick wants something more to eat, he does not like butter and cheese, so I will take with me a handkerchief full of dried pears and a pitcher of vinegar for him to drink.\" Then she bolted the upper half of the door fast, but unhinged the lower door, and took it on her back, believing that when she had placed the door in security the house must be well taken care of. Catherine took her time on the way, and thought, \"Frederick will rest himself so much the longer.\" When she had once reached him she said, \"Here is the house-door for you, Frederick, and now you can take care of the house yourself.\" - \"Oh, heavens,\" said he, \"what a wise wife I have! She takes the under-door off the hinges that everything may run in, and bolts the upper one. It is now too late to go back home again, but since you have brought the door here, you shall just carry it farther.\" - \"I will carry the door, Frederick, but the dried pears and the vinegar-jug will be too heavy for me, I will hang them on the door, it may carry them.\"\n\nAnd now they went into the forest, and sought the rogues, but did not find them. At length as it grew dark they climbed into a tree and resolved to spend the night there. Scarcely, however, had they sat down at the top of it than the rascals came thither who carry away with them what does not want to go, and find things before they are lost. They sat down under the very tree in which Frederick and Catherine were sitting, lighted a fire, and were about to share their booty. Frederick got down on the other side and collected some stones together. Then he climbed up again with them, and wished to throw them at the thieves and kill them. The stones, however, did not hit them, and the knaves cried, \"It will soon be morning, the wind is shaking down the fir-apples. Catherine still had the door on her back, and as it pressed so heavily on her, she thought it was the fault of the dried pears, and said, \"Frederick, I must throw the pears down.\" - \"No, Catherine, not now,\" he replied, \"they might betray us.\" - \"Oh, but, Frederick, I must! They weigh me down far too much.\" - \"Do it, then, and be hanged!\" Then the dried pears rolled down between the branches, and the rascals below said, \"The leaves are falling.\" A short time afterwards, as the door was still heavy, Catherine said, \"Ah, Frederick, I must pour out the vinegar.\" - \"No, Catherine, you must not, it might betray us.\" - \"Ah, but, Frederick, I must, it weighs me down far too much.\" - \"Then do it and be hanged!\" So she emptied out the vinegar, and it besprinkled the robbers. They said amongst themselves, \"The dew is already falling.\" At length Catherine thought, \"Can it really be the door which weighs me down so?\" and said, \"Frederick, I must throw the door down.\" - \"No, not now, Catherine, it might discover us.\" - \"Oh, but, Frederick, I must. It weighs me down far too much.\" - \"Oh, no, Catherine, do hold it fast.\" - \"Ah, Frederick, I am letting it fall!\" - \"Let it go, then, in the devil\'s name.\" Then it fell down with a violent clatter, and the rascals below cried, \"The devil is coming down the tree!\" and they ran away and left everything behind them. Early next morning, when the two came down they found all their gold again, and carried it home.\n\nWhen they were once more at home, Frederick said, \"And now, Catherine, you, too, must be industrious and work.\" - \"Yes, Frederick, I will soon do that, I will go into the field and cut corn.\" When Catherine got into the field, she said to herself, \"Shall I eat before I cut, or shall I sleep before I cut? Oh, I will eat first.\" Then Catherine ate and eating made her sleepy, and she began to cut, and half in a dream cut all her clothes to pieces, her apron, her gown, and her shift. When Catherine awoke again after a long sleep she was standing there half-naked, and said to herself, \"Is it I, or is it not I? Alas, it is not I.\" In the meantime night came, and Catherine ran into the village, knocked at her husband\'s window, and cried, \"Frederick.\" - \"What is the matter?\" - \"I should very much like to know if Catherine is in?\" - \"Yes, yes,\" replied Frederick, \"she must be in and asleep.\" Said she, \"\'Tis well, then I am certainly at home already,\" and ran away.\n\nOutside Catherine found some vagabonds who were going to steal. Then she went to them and said, \"I will help you to steal.\" The rascals thought that she knew the situation of the place, and were willing. Catherine went in front of the houses, and cried, \"Good folks, have you anything? We want to steal.\" The thieves thought to themselves, \"That\'s a fine way of doing things,\" and wished themselves once more rid of Catherine. Then they said to her, \"Outside the village the pastor has some turnips in the field. Go there and pull up some turnips for us.\" Catherine went to the ground, and began to pull them up, but was so idle that she did not gather them together. Then a man came by, saw her, and stood still and thought that it was the devil who was thus rooting amongst the turnips. He ran away into the village to the pastor, and said, \"Mr. Pastor, the devil is in your turnip-ground, rooting up turnips.\" - \"Ah, heavens,\" answered the pastor, \"I have a lame foot, I cannot go out and drive him away.\" Said the man, \"Then I will carry you on my back,\" and he carried him out on his back. And when they came to the ground, Catherine arose and stood up her full height. \"Ah, the devil!\" cried the pastor, and both hurried away, and in his great fright the pastor could run better with his lame foot than the man who had carried him on his back could do with his sound one.\n</string>
    <string name="story330text">This story, my dear young folks, seems to be false, but it really is true, for my grandfather, from whom I have it, used always, when relating it, to say complacently, \"It must be true, my son, or else no one could tell it to you.\" The story is as follows. One Sunday morning about harvest time, just as the buckwheat was in bloom, the sun was shining brightly in heaven, the east wind was blowing warmly over the stubble-fields, the larks were singing in the air, the bees buzzing among the buckwheat, the people were all going in their Sunday clothes to church, and all creatures were happy, and the hedgehog was happy too.\nThe hedgehog, however, was standing by his door with his arms akimbo, enjoying the morning breezes, and slowly trilling a little song to himself, which was neither better nor worse than the songs which hedgehogs are in the habit of singing on a blessed Sunday morning. Whilst he was thus singing half aloud to himself, it suddenly occurred to him that, while his wife was washing and drying the children, he might very well take a walk into the field, and see how his turnips were going on. The turnips were, in fact, close beside his house, and he and his family were accustomed to eat them, for which reason he looked upon them as his own. No sooner said than done. The hedgehog shut the house-door behind him, and took the path to the field. He had not gone very far from home, and was just turning round the sloe-bush which stands there outside the field, to go up into the turnip-field, when he observed the hare who had gone out on business of the same kind, namely, to visit his cabbages. When the hedgehog caught sight of the hare, he bade him a friendly good morning. But the hare, who was in his own way a distinguished gentleman, and frightfully haughty, did not return the hedgehog\'s greeting, but said to him, assuming at the same time a very contemptuous manner, \"How do you happen to be running about here in the field so early in the morning?\" - \"I am taking a walk,\" said the hedgehog. \"A walk!\" said the hare, with a smile. \"It seems to me that you might use your legs for a better purpose.\" This answer made the hedgehog furiously angry, for he can bear anything but an attack on his legs, just because they are crooked by nature. So now the hedgehog said to the hare, \"You seem to imagine that you can do more with your legs than I with mine.\" - \"That is just what I do think,\" said the hare. \"That can be put to the test,\" said the hedgehog. \"I wager that if we run a race, I will outstrip you.\" - \"That is ridiculous! You with your short legs!\" said the hare, \"but for my part I am willing, if you have such a monstrous fancy for it. What shall we wager?\" - \"A golden louis-d\'or and a bottle of brandy,\" said the hedgehog. \"Done,\" said the hare. \"Shake hands on it, and then we may as well come off at once.\" - \"Nay,\" said the hedgehog, \"there is no such great hurry! I am still fasting, I will go home first, and have a little breakfast. In half-an-hour I will be back again at this place.\"\n\nHereupon the hedgehog departed, for the hare was quite satisfied with this. On his way the hedgehog thought to himself, \"The hare relies on his long legs, but I will contrive to get the better of him. He may be a great man, but he is a very silly fellow, and he shall pay for what he has said.\" So when the hedgehog reached home, he said to his wife, \"Wife, dress thyself quickly, thou must go out to the field with me.\" - \"What is going on, then?\" said his wife. \"I have made a wager with the hare, for a gold louis-d\'or and a bottle of brandy. I am to run a race with him, and thou must be present.\" - \"Good heavens, husband,\" the wife now cried, \"art thou not right in thy mind, hast thou completely lost thy wits? What can make thee want to run a race with the hare?\" - \"Hold thy tongue, woman,\" said the hedgehog, \"that is my affair. Don\'t begin to discuss things which are matters for men. Be off, dress thyself, and come with me.\" What could the hedgehog\'s wife do? She was forced to obey him, whether she liked it or not.\n\nSo when they had set out on their way together, the hedgehog said to his wife, \"Now pay attention to what I am going to say. Look you, I will make the long field our race-course. The hare shall run in one furrow, and I in another, and we will begin to run from the top. Now all that thou hast to do is to place thyself here below in the furrow, and when the hare arrives at the end of the furrow, on the other side of thee, thou must cry out to him, \'I am here already!\'\"\n\nThen they reached the field, and the hedgehog showed his wife her place, and then walked up the field. When he reached the top, the hare was already there. \"Shall we start?\" said the hare. \"Certainly,\" said the hedgehog. \"Then both at once.\" So saying, each placed himself in his own furrow. The hare counted, \"Once, twice, thrice, and away!\" and went off like a whirlwind down the field. The hedgehog, however, only ran about three paces, and then he stooped down in the furrow, and stayed quietly where he was. When the hare therefore arrived in full career at the lower end of the field, the hedgehog\'s wife met him with the cry, \"I am here already!\" The hare was shocked and wondered not a little, he thought no other than that it was the hedgehog himself who was calling to him, for the hedgehog\'s wife looked just like her husband. The hare, however, thought to himself, \"That has not been done fairly,\" and cried, \"It must be run again, let us have it again.\" And once more he went off like the wind in a storm, so that he seemed to fly. But the hedgehog\'s wife stayed quietly in her place. So when the hare reached the top of the field, the hedgehog himself cried out to him, \"I am here already.\" The hare, however, quite beside himself with anger, cried, \"It must be run again, we must have it again.\" - \"All right,\" answered the hedgehog, \"for my part we\'ll run as often as you choose.\" So the hare ran seventy-three times more, and the hedgehog always held out against him, and every time the hare reached either the top or the bottom, either the hedgehog or his wife said, \"I am here already.\"\n\nAt the seventy-fourth time, however, the hare could no longer reach the end. In the middle of the field he fell to the ground, blood streamed out of his mouth, and he lay dead on the spot. But the hedgehog took the louis-d\'or which he had won and the bottle of brandy, called his wife out of the furrow, and both went home together in great delight, and if they are not dead, they are living there still.\n\nThis is how it happened that the hedgehog made the hare run races with him on the Buxtehuder heath till he died, and since that time no hare has ever had any fancy for running races with a Buxtehuder hedgehog.\n\nThe moral of this story, however, is, firstly, that no one, however great he may be, should permit himself to jest at any one beneath him, even if he be only a hedgehog. And, secondly, it teaches, that when a man marries, he should take a wife in his own position, who looks just as he himself looks. So whosoever is a hedgehog let him see to it that his wife is a hedgehog also, and so forth.</string>
    <string name="story331text">There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were there. He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at the top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen asleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in her arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree.\nThe forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself, \"Thou wilt take him home with thee, and bring him up with thy Lina.\" He took it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. The one, however, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird had carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that when they did not see each other they were sad.\n\nThe forester, however, had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out to the spring. Lina saw this and said, \"Hark you, old Sanna, why are you fetching so much water?\" - \"If thou wilt never repeat it to anyone, I will tell thee why.\" So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone, and then the cook said, \"Early to-morrow morning, when the forester is out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the kettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.\"\n\nBetimes next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he was gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to Fundevogel, \"If thou wilt never leave me, I too will never leave thee.\" Fundevogel said, \"Neither now, nor ever will I leave thee.\" Then said Lina, \"Then I will tell thee. Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water into the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said that if I would promise not to tell any one she would tell me, and I said I would be sure not to tell any one, and she said that early to-morrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle full of water, throw thee into it and boil thee; but we will get up quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.\"\n\nThe two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went away. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the bed-room to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came in, and went to the beds, both the children were gone. Then she was terribly alarmed, and she said to herself, \"What shall I say now when the forester comes home and sees that the children are gone? They must be followed instantly to get them back again.\"\n\nThen the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and overtake the children. The children, however, were sitting outside the forest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina said to Fundevogel, \"Never leave me, and I will never leave thee.\" Fundevogel said, \"Neither now, nor ever.\" Then said Lina, \"Do thou become a rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.\" When the three servants came to the forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but the children were nowhere. Then said they, \"There is nothing to be done here,\" and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing in the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it. Then the old cook scolded and said, \"You simpletons, you should have cut the rose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it home with you; go, and do it once.\" They had therefore to go out and look for the second time. The children, however, saw them coming from a distance. Then Lina said, \"Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave thee.\" Fundevogel said, \"Neither now, nor ever.\" Said Lina, \"Then do thou become a church, and I\'ll be the chandelier in it.\" So when the three servants came, nothing was there but a church, with a chandelier in it. They said therefore to each other, \"What can we do here, let us go home.\" When they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them; so they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and that there was a chandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said, \"You fools! why did you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home with you?\" And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went with the three servants in pursuit of the children. The children, however, saw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling after them. Then said Lina, \"Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave thee.\" Then said Fundevogel, \"Neither now, nor ever.\" Said Lina, \"Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.\" The cook, however, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it, and was about to drink it up. But the duck swam quickly to her, seized her head in its beak and drew her into the water, and there the old witch had to drown. Then the children went home together, and were heartily delighted, and if they are not dead, they are living still.</string>
    <string name="story332text">Once upon a time there was a man who did nothing but gamble, and for that reason people never called him anything but Gambling Hansel, and as he never ceased to gamble, he played away his house and all that he had. Now the very day before his creditors were to take his house from him, came the Lord and St. Peter, and asked him to give them shelter for the night. Then Gambling Hansel said, \"For my part, you may stay the night, but I cannot give you a bed or anything to eat.\" So the Lord said he was just to take them in, and they themselves would buy something to eat, to which Gambling Hansel made no objection. Thereupon St. Peter gave him three groschen, and said he was to go to the baker\'s and fetch some bread. So Gambling Hansel went, but when he reached the house where the other gambling vagabonds were gathered together, they, although they had won all that he had, greeted him clamorously, and said, \"Hansel, do come in.\" - \"Oh,\" said he, \"do you want to win the three groschen too?\" On this they would not let him go. So he went in, and played away the three groschen also. Meanwhile St. Peter and the Lord were waiting, and as he was so long in coming, they set out to meet him. When Gambling Hansel came, however, he pretended that the money had fallen into the gutter, and kept raking about in it all the while to find it, but our Lord already knew that he had lost it in play. St. Peter again gave him three groschen, and now he did not allow himself to be led away once more, but fetched them the loaf. Our Lord then inquired if he had no wine, and he said, \"Alack, sir, the casks are all empty!\" But the Lord said he was to go down into the cellar, for the best wine was still there. For a long time he would not believe this, but at length he said, \"Well, I will go down, but I know that there is none there.\" When he turned the tap, however, lo and behold, the best of wine ran out! So he took it to them, and the two passed the night there. Early next day our Lord told Gambling Hansel that he might beg three favours. The Lord expected that he would ask to go to Heaven; but Gambling Hansel asked for a pack of cards with which he could win everything, for dice with which he would win everything, and for a tree whereon every kind of fruit would grow, and from which no one who had climbed up, could descend until he bade him do so. The Lord gave him all that he had asked, and departed with St. Peter.\nAnd now Gambling Hansel at once set about gambling in real earnest, and before long he had gained half the world. Upon this St. Peter said to the Lord, \"Lord, this thing must not go on, he will win, and thou lose, the whole world. We must send Death to him.\" When Death appeared, Gambling Hansel had just seated himself at the gaming-table, and Death said, \"Hansel, come out a while.\" But Gambling Hansel said, \"Just wait a little until the game is done, and in the meantime get up into that tree out there, and gather a little fruit that we may have something to munch on our way.\" Thereupon Death climbed up, but when he wanted to come down again, he could not, and Gambling Hansel left him up there for seven years, during which time no one died.\n\nSo St. Peter said to the Lord, \"Lord, this thing must not go on. People no longer die; we must go ourselves.\" And they went themselves, and the Lord commanded Hansel to let Death come down. So Hansel went at once to Death and said to him, \"Come down,\" and Death took him directly and put an end to him. They went away together and came to the next world, and then Gambling Hansel made straight for the door of Heaven, and knocked at it. \"Who is there?\" - \"Gambling Hansel.\" - \"Ah, we will have nothing to do with him! Begone!\" So he went to the door of Purgatory, and knocked once more. \"Who is there?\" - \"Gambling Hansel.\" - \"Ah, there is quite enough weeping and wailing here without him. We do not want to gamble, just go away again.\" Then he went to the door of Hell, and there they let him in. There was, however, no one at home but old Lucifer and the crooked devils who had just been doing their evil work in the world. And no sooner was Hansel there than he sat down to gamble again. Lucifer, however, had nothing to lose, but his mis-shapen devils, and Gambling Hansel won them from him, as with his cards he could not fail to do. And now he was off again with his crooked devils, and they went to Hohenfuert and pulled up a hop-pole, and with it went to Heaven and began to thrust the pole against it, and Heaven began to crack. So again St. Peter said, \"Lord, this thing cannot go on, we must let him in, or he will throw us down from Heaven.\" And they let him in. But Gambling Hansel instantly began to play again, and there was such a noise and confusion that there was no hearing what they themselves were saying. Therefore St. Peter once more said, \"Lord, this cannot go on, we must throw him down, or he will make all Heaven rebellious.\" So they went to him at once, and threw him down, and his soul broke into fragments, and went into the gambling vagabonds who are living this very day.</string>
    <string name="story333text">A certain tailor who was great at boasting but ill at doing, took it into his head to go abroad for a while, and look about the world. As soon as he could manage it, he left his workshop, and wandered on his way, over hill and dale, sometimes hither, sometimes thither, but ever on and on. Once when he was out he perceived in the blue distance a steep hill, and behind it a tower reaching to the clouds, which rose up out of a wild dark forest. \"Thunder and lightning,\" cried the tailor, \"what is that?\" and as he was strongly goaded by curiosity, he went boldly towards it. But what made the tailor open his eyes and mouth when he came near it, was to see that the tower had legs, and leapt in one bound over the steep hill, and was now standing as an all powerful giant before him. \"What dost thou want here, thou tiny fly\'s leg?\" cried the giant, with a voice as if it were thundering on every side. The tailor whimpered, \"I want just to look about and see if I can earn a bit of bread for myself, in this forest.\" If that is what thou art after,\" said the giant, \"thou mayst have a place with me.\" - \"If it must be, why not? What wages shall I receive?\" - \"Thou shalt hear what wages thou shalt have. Every year three hundred and sixty-five days, and when it is leap-year, one more into the bargain. Does that suit thee?\" - \"All right,\" replied the tailor, and thought, in his own mind, \"a man must cut his coat according to his cloth; I will try to get away as fast as I can.\" On this the giant said to him, \"Go, little ragamuffin, and fetch me a jug of water.\" - \"Had I not better bring the well itself at once, and the spring too?\" asked the boaster, and went with the pitcher to the water. \"What! the well and the spring too,\" growled the giant in his beard, for he was rather clownish and stupid, and began to be afraid. \"That knave is not a fool, he has a wizard in his body. Be on thy guard, old Hans, this is no serving-man for thee.\" When the tailor had brought the water, the giant bade him go into the forest, and cut a couple of blocks of wood and bring them back. \"Why not the whole forest, at once, with one stroke. The whole forest, young and old, with all that is there, both rough and smooth?\" asked the little tailor, and went to cut the wood. \"What! the whole forest, young and old, with all that is there, both rough and smooth, and the well and its spring too,\" growled the credulous giant in his beard, and was still more terrified. \"The knave can do much more than bake apples, and has a wizard in his body. Be on thy guard, old Hans, this is no serving-man for thee!\" When the tailor had brought the wood, the giant commanded him to shoot two or three wild boars for supper. \"Why not rather a thousand at one shot, and bring them all here?\" inquired the ostentatious tailor. \"What!\" cried the timid giant in great terror; \"Let well alone to-night, and lie down to rest.\"\nThe giant was so terribly alarmed that he could not close an eye all night long for thinking what would be the best way to get rid of this accursed sorcerer of a servant. Time brings counsel. Next morning the giant and the tailor went to a marsh, round which stood a number of willow-trees. Then said the giant, \"Hark thee, tailor, seat thyself on one of the willow-branches, I long of all things to see if thou art big enough to bend it down.\" All at once the tailor was sitting on it, holding his breath, and making himself so heavy that the bough bent down. When, however, he was compelled to draw breath, it hurried him (for unfortunately he had not put his vgoose in his pocket) so high into the air that he never was seen again, and this to the great delight of the giant. If the tailor has not fallen down again, he must be hovering about in the air.</string>
    <string name="story334text">A certain miller had little by little fallen into poverty, and had nothing left but his mill and a large apple-tree behind it. Once when he had gone into the forest to fetch wood, an old man stepped up to him whom he had never seen before, and said, \"Why dost thou plague thyself with cutting wood, I will make thee rich, if thou wilt promise me what is standing behind thy mill?\" - \"What can that be but my apple-tree?\" thought the miller, and said, \"Yes,\" and gave a written promise to the stranger. He, however, laughed mockingly and said, \"When three years have passed, I will come and carry away what belongs to me,\" and then he went. When the miller got home, his wife came to meet him and said, \"Tell me, miller, from whence comes this sudden wealth into our house? All at once every box and chest was filled; no one brought it in, and I know not how it happened.\" He answered, \"It comes from a stranger who met me in the forest, and promised me great treasure. I, in return, have promised him what stands behind the mill; we can very well give him the big apple-tree for it.\" - \"Ah, husband,\" said the terrified wife, \"that must have been the devil! He did not mean the apple-tree, but our daughter, who was standing behind the mill sweeping the yard.\"\n\nThe miller\'s daughter was a beautiful, pious girl, and lived through the three years in the fear of God and without sin. When therefore the time was over, and the day came when the Evil-one was to fetch her, she washed herself clean, and made a circle round herself with chalk. The devil appeared quite early, but he could not come near to her. Angrily, he said to the miller, \"Take all water away from her, that she may no longer be able to wash herself, for otherwise I have no power over her.\" The miller was afraid, and did so. The next morning the devil came again, but she had wept on her hands, and they were quite clean. Again he could not get near her, and furiously said to the miller, \"Cut her hands off, or else I cannot get the better of her.\" The miller was shocked and answered, \"How could I cut off my own child\'s hands?\" Then the Evil-one threatened him and said, \"If thou dost not do it thou art mine, and I will take thee thyself.\" The father became alarmed, and promised to obey him. So he went to the girl and said, \"My child, if I do not cut off both thine hands, the devil will carry me away, and in my terror I have promised to do it. Help me in my need, and forgive me the harm I do thee.\" She replied, \"Dear father, do with me what you will, I am your child.\" Thereupon she laid down both her hands, and let them be cut off. The devil came for the third time, but she had wept so long and so much on the stumps, that after all they were quite clean. Then he had to give in, and had lost all right over her.\n\nThe miller said to her, \"I have by means of thee received such great wealth that I will keep thee most delicately as long as thou livest.\" But she replied, \"Here I cannot stay, I will go forth, compassionate people will give me as much as I require.\" Thereupon she caused her maimed arms to be bound to her back, and by sunrise she set out on her way, and walked the whole day until night fell. Then she came to a royal garden, and by the shimmering of the moon she saw that trees covered with beautiful fruits grew in it, but she could not enter, for there was much water round about it. And as she had walked the whole day and not eaten one mouthful, and hunger tormented her, she thought, \"Ah, if I were but inside, that I might eat of the fruit, else must I die of hunger!\" Then she knelt down, called on God the Lord, and prayed. And suddenly an angel came towards her, who made a dam in the water, so that the moat became dry and she could walk through it. And now she went into the garden and the angel went with her. She saw a tree covered with beautiful pears, but they were all counted. Then she went to them, and to still her hunger, ate one with her mouth from the tree, but no more. The gardener was watching; but as the angel was standing by, he was afraid and thought the maiden was a spirit, and was silent, neither did he dare to cry out, or to speak to the spirit. When she had eaten the pear, she was satisfied, and went and concealed herself among the bushes. The King to whom the garden belonged, came down to it next morning, and counted, and saw that one of the pears was missing, and asked the gardener what had become of it, as it was not lying beneath the tree, but was gone. Then answered the gardener, \"Last night, a spirit came in, who had no hands, and ate off one of the pears with its mouth.\" The King said, \"How did the spirit get over the water, and where did it go after it had eaten the pear?\" The gardener answered, \"Some one came in a snow-white garment from heaven who made a dam, and kept back the water, that the spirit might walk through the moat. And as it must have been an angel, I was afraid, and asked no questions, and did not cry out. When the spirit had eaten the pear, it went back again.\" The King said, \"If it be as thou sayest, I will watch with thee to-night.\"\n\nWhen it grew dark the King came into the garden and brought a priest with him, who was to speak to the spirit. All three seated themselves beneath the tree and watched. At midnight the maiden came creeping out of the thicket, went to the tree, and again ate one pear off it with her mouth, and beside her stood the angel in white garments. Then the priest went out to them and said, \"Comest thou from heaven or from earth? Art thou a spirit, or a human being?\" She replied, \"I am no spirit, but an unhappy mortal deserted by all but God.\" The King said, \"If thou art forsaken by all the world, yet will I not forsake thee.\" He took her with him into his royal palace, and as she was so beautiful and good, he loved her with all his heart, had silver hands made for her, and took her to wife.\n\nAfter a year the King had to take the field, so he commended his young Queen to the care of his mother and said, \"If she is brought to bed take care of her, nurse her well, and tell me of it at once in a letter.\" Then she gave birth to a fine boy. So the old mother made haste to write and announce the joyful news to him. But the messenger rested by a brook on the way, and as he was fatigued by the great distance, he fell asleep. Then came the Devil, who was always seeking to injure the good Queen, and exchanged the letter for another, in which was written that the Queen had brought a monster into the world. When the King read the letter he was shocked and much troubled, but he wrote in answer that they were to take great care of the Queen and nurse her well until his arrival. The messenger went back with the letter, but rested at the same place and again fell asleep. Then came the Devil once more, and put a different letter in his pocket, in which it was written that they were to put the Queen and her child to death. The old mother was terribly shocked when she received the letter, and could not believe it. She wrote back again to the King, but received no other answer, because each time the Devil substituted a false letter, and in the last letter it was also written that she was to preserve the Queen\'s tongue and eyes as a token that she had obeyed.\n\nBut the old mother wept to think such innocent blood was to be shed, and had a hind brought by night and cut out her tongue and eyes, and kept them. Then said she to the Queen, \"I cannot have thee killed as the King commands, but here thou mayst stay no longer. Go forth into the wide world with thy child, and never come here again.\" The poor woman tied her child on her back, and went away with eyes full of tears. She came into a great wild forest, and then she fell on her knees and prayed to God, and the angel of the Lord appeared to her and led her to a little house on which was a sign with the words, \"Here all dwell free.\" A snow-white maiden came out of the little house and said, \'Welcome, Lady Queen,\" and conducted her inside. Then they unbound the little boy from her back, and held him to her breast that he might feed, and laid him in a beautifully-made little bed. Then said the poor woman, \"From whence knowest thou that I was a queen?\" The white maiden answered, \"I am an angel sent by God, to watch over thee and thy child.\" The Queen stayed seven years in the little house, and was well cared for, and by God\'s grace, because of her piety, her hands which had been cut off, grew once more.\n\nAt last the King came home again from the war, and his first wish was to see his wife and the child. Then his aged mother began to weep and said, \"Thou wicked man, why didst thou write to me that I was to take those two innocent lives?\" and she showed him the two letters which the Evil-one had forged, and then continued, \"I did as thou badest me,\" and she showed the tokens, the tongue and eyes. Then the King began to weep for his poor wife and his little son so much more bitterly than she was doing, that the aged mother had compassion on him and said, \"Be at peace, she still lives; I secretly caused a hind to be killed, and took these tokens from it; but I bound the child to thy wife\'s back and bade her go forth into the wide world, and made her promise never to come back here again, because thou wert so angry with her.\" Then spoke the King, \"I will go as far as the sky is blue, and will neither eat nor drink until I have found again my dear wife and my child, if in the meantime they have not been killed, or died of hunger.\"\n\nThereupon the King travelled about for seven long years, and sought her in every cleft of the rocks and in every cave, but he found her not, and thought she had died of want. During the whole of this time he neither ate nor drank, but God supported him. At length he came into a great forest, and found therein the little house whose sign was, \"Here all dwell free.\" Then forth came the white maiden, took him by the hand, led him in, and said, \"Welcome, Lord King,\" and asked him from whence he came. He answered, \"Soon shall I have travelled about for the space of seven years, and I seek my wife and her child, but cannot find them.\" The angel offered him meat and drink, but he did not take anything, and only wished to rest a little. Then he lay down to sleep, and put a handkerchief over his face.\n\nThereupon the angel went into the chamber where the Queen sat with her son, whom she usually called \"Sorrowful,\" and said to her, \"Go out with thy child, thy husband hath come.\" So she went to the place where he lay, and the handkerchief fell from his face. Then said she, \"Sorrowful, pick up thy father\'s handkerchief, and cover his face again.\" The child picked it up, and put it over his face again. The King in his sleep heard what passed, and had pleasure in letting the handkerchief fall once more. But the child grew impatient, and said, \"Dear mother, how can I cover my father\'s face when I have no father in this world? I have learnt to say the prayer, \'Our Father, which art in Heaven,\' thou hast told me that my father was in Heaven, and was the good God, and how can I know a wild man like this? He is not my father.\" When the King heard that, he got up, and asked who they were. Then said she, \"I am thy wife, and that is thy son, Sorrowful.\" And he saw her living hands, and said, \"My wife had silver hands.\" She answered, \"The good God has caused my natural hands to grow again;\" and the angel went into the inner room, and brought the silver hands, and showed them to him. Hereupon he knew for a certainty that it was his dear wife and his dear child, and he kissed them, and was glad, and said, \"A heavy stone has fallen from off mine heart.\" Then the angel of God gave them one meal with her, and after that they went home to the King\'s aged mother. There were great rejoicings everywhere, and the King and Queen were married again, and lived contentedly to their happy end.\n</string>
    <string name="story335text">Let no one ever say that a poor tailor cannot do great things and win high honors; all that is needed is that he should go to the right smithy, and what is of most consequence, that he should have good luck. A civil, adroit tailor\'s apprentice once went out travelling, and came into a great forest, and, as he did not know the way, he lost himself. Night fell, and nothing was left for him to do, but to seek a bed in this painful solitude. He might certainly have found a good bed on the soft moss, but the fear of wild beasts let him have no rest there, and at last he was forced to make up his mind to spend the night in a tree. He sought out a high oak, climbed up to the top of it, and thanked God that he had his goose with him, for otherwise the wind which blew over the top of the tree would have carried him away.\nAfter he had spent some hours in the darkness, not without fear and trembling, he saw at a very short distance the glimmer of a light, and as he thought that a human habitation might be there, where he would be better off than on the branches of a tree, he got carefully down and went towards the light. It guided him to a small hut that was woven together of reeds and rushes. He knocked boldly, the door opened, and by the light which came forth he saw a little hoary old man who wore a coat made of bits of colored stuff sewn together. \"Who are you, and what do you want?\" asked the man in a grumbling voice. \"I am a poor tailor,\" he answered, \"whom night has surprised here in the wilderness, and I earnestly beg you to take me into your hut until morning.\" - \"Go your way,\" replied the old man in a surly voice, \"I will have nothing to do with runagates; seek for yourself a shelter elsewhere.\" After these words he was about to slip into his hut again, but the tailor held him so tightly by the corner of his coat, and pleaded so piteously, that the old man, who was not so ill-natured as he wished to appear, was at last softened, and took him into the hut with him where he gave him something to eat, and then pointed out to him a very good bed in a corner.\n\nThe weary tailor needed no rocking; but slept sweetly till morning, but even then would not have thought of getting up, if he had not been aroused by a great noise. A violent sound of screaming and roaring forced its way through the thin walls of the hut. The tailor, full of unwonted courage, jumped up, put his clothes on in haste, and hurried out. Then close by the hut, he saw a great black bull and a beautiful stag, which were just preparing for a violent struggle. They rushed at each other with such extreme rage that the ground shook with their trampling, and the air resounded with their cries. For a long time it was uncertain which of the two would gain the victory; at length the stag thrust his horns into his adversary\'s body, whereupon the bull fell to the earth with a terrific roar, and was thoroughly despatched by a few strokes from the stag.\n\nThe tailor, who had watched the fight with astonishment, was still standing there motionless, when the stag in full career bounded up to him, and before he could escape, caught him up on his great horns. He had not much time to collect his thoughts, for it went in a swift race over stock and stone, mountain and valley, wood and meadow. He held with both hands to the tops of the horns, and resigned himself to his fate. It seemed, however, to him just as if he were flying away. At length the stag stopped in front of a wall of rock, and gently let the tailor down. The tailor, more dead than alive, required a longer time than that to come to himself. When he had in some degree recovered, the stag, which had remained standing by him, pushed its horns with such force against a door which was in the rock, that it sprang open. Flames of fire shot forth, after which followed a great smoke, which hid the stag from his sight. The tailor did not know what to do, or whither to turn, in order to get out of this desert and back to human beings again. Whilst he was standing thus undecided, a voice sounded out of the rock, which cried to him, \"Enter without fear, no evil shall befall you thee.\" He hesitated, but driven by a mysterious force, he obeyed the voice and went through the iron-door into a large spacious hall, whose ceiling, walls and floor were made of shining polished square stones, on each of which were cut letters which were unknown to him. He looked at everything full of admiration, and was on the point of going out again, when he once more heard the voice which said to him, \"Step on the stone which lies in the middle of the hall, and great good fortune awaits thee.\"\n\nHis courage had already grown so great that he obeyed the order. The stone began to give way under his feet, and sank slowly down into the depths. When it was once more firm, and the tailor looked round, he found himself in a hall which in size resembled the former. Here, however, there was more to look at and to admire. Hollow places were cut in the walls, in which stood vases of transparent glass which were filled with colored spirit or with a bluish vapour. On the floor of the hall two great glass chests stood opposite to each other, which at once excited his curiosity. When he went to one of them he saw inside it a handsome structure like a castle surrounded by farm-buildings, stables and barns, and a quantity of other good things. Everything was small, but exceedingly carefully and delicately made, and seemed to be cut out by a dexterous hand with the greatest exactitude.\n\nHe might not have turned away his eyes from the consideration of this rarity for some time, if the voice had not once more made itself heard. It ordered him to turn round and look at the glass chest which was standing opposite. How his admiration increased when he saw therein a maiden of the greatest beauty! She lay as if asleep, and was wrapped in her long fair hair as in a precious mantle. Her eyes were closely shut, but the brightness of her complexion and a ribbon which her breathing moved to and fro, left no doubt that she was alive. The tailor was looking at the beauty with beating heart, when she suddenly opened her eyes, and started up at the sight of him in joyful terror. \"Just Heaven!\" cried she, \"my deliverance is at hand! Quick, quick, help me out of my prison; if thou pushest back the bolt of this glass coffin, then I shall be free.\" The tailor obeyed without delay, and she immediately raised up the glass lid, came out and hastened into the corner of the hall, where she covered herself with a large cloak. Then she seated herself on a stone, ordered the young man to come to her, and after she had imprinted a friendly kiss on his lips, she said, \"My long-desired deliverer, kind Heaven has guided thee to me, and put an end to my sorrows. On the self- same day when they end, shall thy happiness begin. Thou art the husband chosen for me by Heaven, and shalt pass thy life in unbroken joy, loved by me, and rich to overflowing in every earthly possession. Seat thyself, and listen to the story of my life:\n\n\"I am the daughter of a rich count. My parents died when I was still in my tender youth, and recommended me in their last will to my elder brother, by whom I was brought up. We loved each other so tenderly, and were so alike in our way of thinking and our inclinations, that we both embraced the resolution never to marry, but to stay together to the end of our lives. In our house there was no lack of company; neighbors and friends visited us often, and we showed the greatest hospitality to every one. So it came to pass one evening that a stranger came riding to our castle, and, under pretext of not being able to get on to the next place, begged for shelter for the night. We granted his request with ready courtesy, and he entertained us in the most agreeable manner during supper by conversation intermingled with stories. My brother liked the stranger so much that he begged him to spend a couple of days with us, to which, after some hesitation, he consented. We did not rise from table until late in the night, the stranger was shown to room, and I hastened, as I was tired, to lay my limbs in my soft bed. Hardly had I slept for a short time, when the sound of faint and delightful music awoke me. As I could not conceive from whence it came, I wanted to summon my waiting-maid who slept in the next room, but to my astonishment I found that speech was taken away from me by an unknown force. I felt as if a mountain were weighing down my breast, and was unable to make the very slightest sound. In the meantime, by the light of my night-lamp, I saw the stranger enter my room through two doors which were fast bolted. He came to me and said, that by magic arts which were at his command, he had caused the lovely music to sound in order to awaken me, and that he now forced his way through all fastenings with the intention of offering me his hand and heart. My repugnance to his magic arts was, however, so great, that I vouchsafed him no answer. He remained for a time standing without moving, apparently with the idea of waiting for a favorable decision, but as I continued to keep silence, he angrily declared he would revenge himself and find means to punish my pride, and left the room. I passed the night in the greatest disquietude, and only fell asleep towards morning. When I awoke, I hurried to my brother, but did not find him in his room, and the attendants told me that he had ridden forth with the stranger to the chase by daybreak.\n\n\"I at once suspected nothing good. I dressed myself quickly, ordered my palfrey to be saddled, and accompanied only by one servant, rode full gallop to the forest. The servant fell with his horse, and could not follow me, for the horse had broken its foot. I pursued my way without halting, and in a few minutes I saw the stranger coming towards me with a beautiful stag which he led by a cord. I asked him where he had left my brother, and how he had come by this stag, out of whose great eyes I saw tears flowing. Instead of answering me, he began to laugh loudly. I fell into a great rage at this, pulled out a pistol and discharged it at the monster; but the ball rebounded from his breast and went into my horse\'s head. I fell to the ground, and the stranger muttered some words which deprived me of consciousness.\n\n\"When I came to my senses again I found myself in this underground cave in a glass coffin. The magician appeared once again, and said he had changed my brother into a stag, my castle with all that belonged to it, diminished in size by his arts, he had shut up in the other glass chest, and my people, who were all turned into smoke, he had confined in glass bottles. He told me that if I would now comply with his wish, it was an easy thing for him to put everything back in its former state, as he had nothing to do but open the vessels, and everything would return once more to its natural form. I answered him as little as I had done the first time. He vanished and left me in my prison, in which a deep sleep came on me. Amongst the visions which passed before my eyes, that was the most comforting in which a young man came and set me free, and when I opened my eyes to-day I saw thee, and beheld my dream fulfilled. Help me to accomplish the other things which happened in those visions. The first is that we lift the glass chest in which my castle is enclosed, on to that broad stone.\"\n\nAs soon as the stone was laden, it began to rise up on high with the maiden and the young man, and mounted through the opening of the ceiling into the upper hall, from whence they then could easily reach the open air. Here the maiden opened the lid, and it was marvellous to behold how the castle, the houses, and the farm buildings which were enclosed, stretched themselves out and grew to their natural size with the greatest rapidity. After this, the maiden and the tailor returned to the cave beneath the earth, and had the vessels which were filled with smoke carried up by the stone. The maiden had scarcely opened the bottles when the blue smoke rushed out and changed itself into living men, in whom she recognized her servants and her people. Her joy was still more increased when her brother, who had killed the magician in the form of the bull, came out of the forest towards them in his human form, and on the self-same day the maiden, in accordance with her promise, gave her hand at the altar to the lucky tailor.</string>
    <string name="story336text">There was once upon a time a rich King who had three daughters, who daily went to walk in the palace garden, and the King was a great lover of all kinds of fine trees, but there was one for which he had such an affection, that if anyone gathered an apple from it he wished him a hundred fathoms underground. And when harvest time came, the apples on this tree were all as red as blood. The three daughters went every day beneath the tree, and looked to see if the wind had not blown down an apple, but they never by any chance found one, and the tree was so loaded with them that it was almost breaking, and the branches hung down to the ground. Then the King\'s youngest child had a great desire for an apple, and said to her sisters, \"Our father loves us far too much to wish us underground, it is my belief that he would only do that to people who were strangers.\" And while she was speaking, the child plucked off quite a large apple, and ran to her sisters, saying, \"Just taste, my dear little sisters, for never in my life have I tasted anything so delightful.\" Then the two other sisters also ate some of the apple, whereupon all three sank deep down into the earth, where they could hear no cock crow.\nWhen mid-day came, the King wished to call them to come to dinner, but they were nowhere to be found. He sought them everywhere in the palace and garden, but could not find them. Then he was much troubled, and made known to the whole land that whosoever brought his daughters back again should have one of them to wife. Hereupon so many young men went about the country in search, that there was no counting them, for every one loved the three children because they were so kind to all, and so fair of face. Three young huntsmen also went out, and when they had travelled about for eight days, they arrived at a great castle, in which were beautiful apartments, and in one room a table was laid on which were delicate dishes which were still so warm that they were smoking, but in the whole of the castle no human being was either to be seen or heard. They waited there for half a day, and the food still remained warm and smoking, and at length they were so hungry that they sat down and ate, and agreed with each other that they would stay and live in that castle, and that one of them, who should be chosen by casting lots, should remain in the house, and the two others seek the King\'s daughters. They cast lots, and the lot fell on the eldest; so next day the two younger went out to seek, and the eldest had to stay home. At mid-day came a small, small mannikin and begged for a piece of bread, then the huntsman took the bread which he had found there, and cut a round off the loaf and was about to give it to him, but whilst he was giving it to the mannikin, the latter let it fall, and asked the huntsman to be so good as to give him that piece again. The huntsman was about to do so and stooped, on which the mannikin took a stick, seized him by the hair, and gave him a good beating. Next day, the second stayed at home, and he fared no better. When the two others returned in the evening, the eldest said, \"Well, how have you got on?\"\n\n\"Oh, very badly,\" said he, and then they lamented their misfortune together, but they said nothing about it to the youngest, for they did not like him at all, and always called him Stupid Hans, because he did not exactly belong to the forest. On the third day, the youngest stayed at home, and again the little mannikin came and begged for a piece of bread. When the youth gave it to him, the elf let it fall as before, and asked him to be so good as to give him that piece again. Then said Hans to the little mannikin, \"What! canst thou not pick up that piece thyself? If thou wilt not take as much trouble as that for thy daily bread, thou dost not deserve to have it.\" Then the mannikin grew very angry and said he was to do it, but the huntsman would not, and took my dear mannikin, and gave him a thorough beating. Then the mannikin screamed terribly, and cried, \"Stop, stop, and let me go, and I will tell thee where the King\'s daughters are.\" When Hans heard that, he left off beating him and the mannikin told him that he was an earth mannikin, and that there were more than a thousand like him, and that if he would go with him he would show him where the King\'s daughters were. Then he showed him a deep well, but there was no water in it. And the elf said that he knew well that the companions Hans had with him did not intend to deal honourably with him, therefore if he wished to deliver the King\'s children, he must do it alone. The two other brothers would also be very glad to recover the King\'s daughters, but they did not want to have any trouble or danger. Hans was therefore to take a large basket, and he must seat himself in it with his hanger and a bell, and be let down. Below were three rooms, and in each of them was a princess, with a many-headed dragon, whose heads she was to comb and trim, but he must cut them off. And having said all this, the elf vanished. When it was evening the two brothers came and asked how he had got on, and he said, \"pretty well so far,\" and that he had seen no one except at mid-day when a little mannikin had come and begged for a piece of bread, that he had given some to him, but that the mannikin had let it fall and had asked him to pick it up again; but as he did not choose to do that, the elf had begun to lose his temper, and that he had done what he ought not, and had given the elf a beating, on which he had told him where the King\'s daughters were. Then the two were so angry at this that they grew green and yellow. Next morning they went to the well together, and drew lots who should first seat himself in the basket, and again the lot fell on the eldest, and he was to seat himself in it, and take the bell with him. Then he said, \"If I ring, you must draw me up again immediately.\" When he had gone down for a short distance, he rang, and they at once drew him up again. Then the second seated himself in the basket, but he did just the same as the first, and then it was the turn of the youngest, but he let himself be lowered quite to the bottom. When he had got out of the basket, he took his hanger, and went and stood outside the first door and listened, and heard the dragon snoring quite loudly. He opened the door slowly, and one of the princesses was sitting there, and had nine dragon\'s heads lying upon her lap, and was combing them. Then he took his hanger and hewed at them, and the nine fell off. The princess sprang up, threw her arms round his neck, embraced and kissed him repeatedly, and took her stomacher, which was made of pure gold, and hung it round his neck. Then he went to the second princess, who had a dragon with five heads to comb, and delivered her also, and to the youngest, who had a dragon with four heads, he went likewise. And they all rejoiced, and embraced him and kissed him without stopping. Then he rang very loud, so that those above heard him, and he placed the princesses one after the other in the basket, and had them all drawn up, but when it came to his own turn he remembered the words of the elf, who had told him that his comrades did not mean well by him. So he took a great stone which was lying there, and placed it in the basket, and when it was about half way up, his false brothers above cut the rope, so that the basket with the stone fell to the ground, and they thought that he was dead, and ran away with the three princesses, making them promise to tell their father that it was they who had delivered them, and then they went to the King, and each demanded a princess in marriage.\n\nIn the meantime the youngest huntsman was wandering about the three chambers in great trouble, fully expecting to have to end his days there, when he saw, hanging on the wall, a flute; then said he, \"Why dost thou hang there, no one can be merry here?\" He looked at the dragons, heads likewise and said, \"You too cannot help me now.\" He walked backwards and forwards for such a long time that he made the surface of the ground quite smooth. But at last other thoughts came to his mind, and he took the flute from the wall, and played a few notes on it, and suddenly a number of elves appeared, and with every note that he sounded one more came. Then he played until the room was entirely filled. They all asked what he desired, so he said he wished to get above ground back to daylight, on which they seized him by every hair that grew on his head, and thus they flew with him onto the earth again. When he was above ground, he at once went to the King\'s palace, just as the wedding of one princess was about to be celebrated, and he went to the room where the King and his three daughters were. When the princesses saw him they fainted. Hereupon the King was angry, and ordered him to be put in prison at once, because he thought he must have done some injury to the children. When the princesses came to themselves, however, they entreated the King to set him free again. The King asked why, and they said that they were not allowed to tell that, but their father said that they were to tell it to the stove. And he went out, listened at the door, and heard everything. Then he caused the two brothers to be hanged on the gallows, and to the third he gave his youngest daughter, and on that occasion I wore a pair of glass shoes, and I struck them against a stone, and they said, \"Klink,\" and were broken.</string>
    <string name="story337text">There were once upon a time two sisters, one of whom had no children and was rich, and the other had five and was a widow, and so poor that she no longer had food enough to satisfy herself and her children. In her need, therefore, she went to her sister, and said, \"My children and I are suffering the greatest hunger; thou art rich, give me a mouthful of bread.\" The very rich sister was as hard as a stone, and said, \"I myself have nothing in the house,\" and drove away the poor creature with harsh words. After some time the husband of the rich sister came home, and was just going to cut himself a piece of bread, but when he made the first cut into the loaf, out flowed red blood. When the woman saw that she was terrified and told him what had occurred. He hurried away to help the widow and her children, but when he entered her room, he found her praying. She had her two youngest children in her arms, and the three eldest were lying dead. He offered her food, but she answered, \"For earthly food have we no longer any desire. God has already satisfied the hunger of three of us, and he will hearken to our supplications likewise.\" Scarcely had she uttered these words than the two little ones drew their last breath, whereupon her heart broke, and she sank down dead.</string>
    <string name="story338text">A poor man had twelve children and had to work day and night in order just to feed them. Thus when the thirteenth came into the world, not knowing what to do in his need, he ran out into the highway, intending to ask the first person whom he met to be the godfather. The first person who came his way was our dear God, who already knew what was in his heart, and God said to him, \"Poor man, I pity you. I will hold your child at his baptism, and care for him, and make him happy on earth.\" The man said, \"Who are you?\" - \"I am God.\" - \"Then I do not wish to have you for a godfather,\" said the man. \"You give to the rich, and let the poor starve.\" Thus spoke the man, for he did not know how wisely God divides out wealth and poverty. Then he turned away from the Lord, and went on his way. Then the devil came to him and said, \"What are you looking for? If you will take me as your child\'s godfather, I will give him an abundance of gold and all the joys of the world as well.\" The man asked, \"Who are you?\" - \"I am the devil.\" - \"Then I do not wish to have you for a godfather,\" said the man. You deceive mankind and lead them astray.\" He went on his way, and then Death, on his withered legs, came walking toward him, and said, \"Take me as your child\'s godfather.\" The man asked, \"Who are you?\" - \"I am Death, who makes everyone equal.\" Then the man said, \"You are the right one. You take away the rich as well as the poor, without distinction. You shall be my child\'s godfather. Death answered, \"I will make your child rich and famous, for he who has me for a friend cannot fail.\" The man said, \"Next Sunday is the baptism. Be there on time.\" Death appeared as he had promised, and served as godfather in an orderly manner.\n\nAfter the boy came of age his godfather appeared to him one day and asked him to go with him. He took him out into the woods and showed him an herb that grew there, saying, \"Now you shall receive your godfather\'s present. I will turn you into a famous physician. Whenever you are called to a sick person I will appear to you. If I stand at the sick person\'s head, you may say with confidence that you can make him well again; then give him some of this herb, and he will recover. But if I stand at the sick person\'s feet, he is mine, and you must say that he is beyond help, and that no physician in the world could save him. But beware of using this herb against my will, or something very bad will happen to you.\"\n\nIt was not long before the young man had become the most famous physician in the whole world. People said of him, \"He only needs to look at the sick in order to immediately know their condition, whether they will regain their health, or are doomed to die.\" And people came to him from far and wide, taking him to their sick, and giving him so much money that he soon became a wealthy man. Now it came to pass that the king became ill. The physician was summoned and was told to say if a recovery were possible. However, when he approached the bed, Death was standing at the sick man\'s feet, and so no herb on earth would be able to help him. \"If I could only deceive death for once,\" thought the physician. \"He will be angry, of course, but because I am his godson he will shut one eye. I will risk it.\" He therefore took hold of the sick man and laid him the other way around, so that Death was now standing at his head. Then he gave the king some of the herb, and he recovered and became healthy again. However, Death came to the physician, made a dark and angry face, threatened him with his finger, and said, \"You have betrayed me. I will overlook it this time because you are my godson, but if you dare to do it again, it will cost you your neck, for I will take you yourself away with me.\"\n\nSoon afterward the king\'s daughter became seriously ill. She was his only child, and he cried day and night until his eyes were going blind. Then he proclaimed that whosoever rescued her from death should become her husband and inherit the crown. When the physician came to the sick girl\'s bed he saw Death at her feet. He should have remembered his godfather\'s warning, but he was so infatuated by the princess\'s great beauty and the prospect of becoming her husband that he threw all thought to the winds. He did not see that Death was looking at him angrily, lifting his hand into the air, and threatening him with his withered fist. He lifted up the sick girl and placed her head where her feet had been. Then he gave her some of the herb, and her cheeks immediately turned red, and life stirred in her once again.\n\nDeath, seeing that he had been cheated out of his property for a second time, approached the physician with long strides and said, \"You are finished. Now it is your turn.\" Then Death seized him so firmly with his ice-cold hand that he could not resist, and led him into an underground cavern. There the physician saw how thousands and thousands of candles were burning in endless rows, some large, others medium-sized, others small. Every instant some died out, and others were relit, so that the little flames seemed to be jumping about in constant change. \"See,\" said Death, \"these are the life-lights of mankind. The large ones belong to children, the medium-sized ones to married people in their best years, and the little ones to old people. However, even children and young people often have only a tiny candle.\" - \"Show me my life-light,\" said the physician, thinking that it still would be very large. Death pointed to a little stump that was just threatening to go out, and said, \"See, there it is.\" - \"Oh, dear godfather,\" said the horrified physician, \"light a new one for me. Do it as a favor to me, so that I can enjoy my life, and become king and the husband of the beautiful princess.\" - \"I cannot,\" answered Death. \"One must go out before a new one is lighted.\" - \"Then set the old one onto a new one that will go on burning after the old one is finished,\" begged the physician. Death pretended that he was going to fulfill this wish and took hold of a large new candle, but, desiring revenge, he purposely made a mistake in relighting it, and the little piece fell down and went out. The physician immediately fell to the ground, and he too was now in the hands of Death.</string>
    <string name="story339text">A poor man had so many children that he had already asked every one in the world to be godfather, and when still another child was born, no one else was left whom he could invite. He knew not what to do, and, in his perplexity, he lay down and fell asleep. Then he dreamt that he was to go outside the gate, and ask the first person who met him to be godfather. When he awoke, he determined to obey his dream, and went outside the gate, and asked the first person who came up to him to be godfather. The stranger presented him with a little glass of water, and said, \"This is a wonderful water, with it thou canst heal the sick, only thou must see where Death is standing. If he is standing by the patient\'s head, give the patient some of the water and he will be healed, but if Death is standing by his feet, all trouble will be in vain, for the sick man must die.\" From this time forth, the man could always say whether a patient could be saved or not, and became famous for his skill, and earned a great deal of money. Once he was called in to the child of the King, and when he entered, he saw death standing by the child\'s head and cured it with the water, and he did the same a second time, but the third time Death was standing by its feet, and then he knew the child was forced to die.\nOnce the man thought he would visit the godfather, and tell him how he had succeeded with the water. But when he entered the house, it was such a strange establishment! On the first flight of stairs, the broom and shovel were disputing, and knocking each other about violently. He asked them, \"Where does the godfather live?\" The broom replied, \"One flight of stairs higher up.\" When he came to the second flight, he saw a heap of dead fingers lying. He asked, \"Where does the godfather live?\" One of the fingers replied, \"One flight of stairs higher.\" On the third flight lay a heap of dead heads, which again directed him to the flight beyond. On the fourth flight, he saw fishes on the fire, which frizzled in the pans and baked themselves. They, too, said, \"One flight of stairs higher.\" And when he had ascended the fifth, he came to the door of a room and peeped through the keyhole, and there he saw the godfather who had a pair of long horns. When he opened the door and went in, the godfather got into bed in a great hurry and covered himself up. Then said the man, \"Sir godfather, what a strange household you have! When I came to your first flight of stairs, the shovel and broom were quarreling, and beating each other violently.\"\n\n\"How stupid you are!\" said the godfather. \"That was the boy and the maid talking to each other.\" - \"But on the second flight I saw dead fingers lying.\" - \"Oh, how silly you are! Those were some roots of scorzonera.\" - \"On the third flight lay a heap of dead men\'s heads.\" - \"Foolish man, those were cabbages.\" - \"On the fourth flight, I saw fishes in a pan, which were hissing and baking themselves.\" When he had said that, the fishes came and served themselves up. \"And when I got to the fifth flight, I peeped through the keyhole of a door, and there, godfather, I saw you, and you had long, long horns.\" - \"Oh, that is a lie!\" The man became alarmed, and ran out, and if he had not, who knows what the godfather would have done to him.</string>
    <string name="story340text">There was once a poor woman who had a son, who much wished to travel, but his mother said, \"How canst thou travel? We have no money at all for thee to take away with thee.\" Then said the son, \"I will manage very well for myself; I will always say, \'Not much, not much, not much.\'\"\n\nSo he walked for a long time and always said, \"Not much, not much, not much.\" Then he passed by a company of fishermen and said, \"God speed you! not much, not much, not much.\" - \"What sayst thou churl, not much?\" And when the net was drawn out they had not caught much fish. So one of them fell on the youth with a stick and said, \"Hast thou never seen me threshing?\" - \"What ought I to say, then?\" asked the youth. \"Thou must say, \'Get it full, get it full.\'\"\n\nAfter this he again walked a long time, and said, \"Get it full, get it full,\" until he came to the gallows, where they had got a poor sinner whom they were about to hang. Then said he, \"Good morning; get it full, get it full.\" - \"What sayst thou, knave, get it full? Dost thou want to make out that there are still more wicked people in the world is not this enough?\" And he again got some blows on his back. \"What am I to say, then?\" said he. \"Thou must say, \'May God have pity on the poor soul.\'\"\n\nAgain the youth walked on for a long while and said, \"May God have pity on the poor soul!\" Then he came to a pit by which stood a knacker who was cutting up a horse. The youth said, \"Good morning; God have pity on the poor soul!\" - \"What dost thou say, thou ill-tempered knave?\" and the knacker gave him such a box on the ear, that he could not see out of his eyes. \"What am I to say, then?\" - \"Thou must say, \'There lies the carrion in the pit!\'\"\n\nSo he walked on, and always said, \"There lies the carrion in the pit, there lies the carrion in the pit.\" And he came to a cart full of people, so he said, \"Good morning, there lies the carrion in the pit!\" Then the cart pushed him into a hole, and the driver took his whip and cracked it upon the youth, till he was forced to crawl back to his mother, and as long as he lived he never went out a-travelling again.</string>
    <string name="story341text">There was once a poor man and a poor woman who had nothing but a little cottage, and who earned their bread by fishing, and always lived from hand to mouth. But it came to pass one day when the man was sitting by the water-side, and casting his net, that he drew out a fish entirely of gold. As he was looking at the fish, full of astonishment, it began to speak and said, \"Hark you, fisherman, if you will throw me back again into the water, I will change your little hut into a splendid castle.\" Then the fisherman answered, \"Of what use is a castle to me, if I have nothing to eat?\" The gold fish continued, \"That shall be taken care of, there will be a cupboard in the castle in which, when you open it, shall be dishes of the most delicate meats, and as many of them as you can desire.\" - \"If that be true,\" said the man, \"then I can well do you a favour.\" - \"Yes,\" said the fish, \"there is, however, the condition that you shall disclose to no one in the world, whosoever he may be, whence your good luck has come, if you speak but one single word, all will be over.\" Then the man threw the wonderful fish back again into the water, and went home. But where his hovel had formerly stood, now stood a great castle. He opened wide his eyes, entered, and saw his wife dressed in beautiful clothes, sitting in a splendid room, and she was quite delighted, and said, \"Husband, how has all this come to pass? It suits me very well.\" - \"Yes,\" said the man, \"it suits me too, but I am frightfully hungry, just give me something to eat.\" Said the wife, \"But I have got nothing and don\'t know where to find anything in this new house.\" - \"There is no need of your knowing,\" said the man, \"for I see yonder a great cupboard, just unlock it.\" When she opened it, there stood cakes, meat, fruit, wine, quite a bright prospect.\nThen the woman cried joyfully, \"What more can you want, my dear?\" and they sat down, and ate and drank together. When they had had enough, the woman said, \"But husband, whence come all these riches?\" - \"Alas,\" answered he, \"do not question me about it, for I dare not tell you anything; if I disclose it to any one, then all our good fortune will fly.\" - \"Very good,\" said she, \"if I am not to know anything, then I do not want to know anything.\" However, she was not in earnest; she never rested day or night, and she goaded her husband until in his impatience he revealed that all was owing to a wonderful golden fish which he had caught, and to which in return he had given its liberty. And as soon as the secret was out, the splendid castle with the cupboard immediately disappeared, they were once more in the old fisherman\'s hut, and the man was obliged to follow his former trade and fish. But fortune would so have it, that he once more drew out the golden fish. \"Listen,\" said the fish, \"if you will throw me back into the water again, I will once more give you the castle with the cupboard full of roast and boiled meats; only be firm, for your life\'s sake don\'t reveal from whom you have it, or you will lose it all again!\" - \"I will take good care,\" answered the fisherman, and threw the fish back into the water. Now at home everything was once more in its former magnificence, and the wife was overjoyed at their good fortune, but curiosity left her no peace, so that after a couple of days she began to ask again how it had come to pass, and how he had managed to secure it. The man kept silence for a short time, but at last she made him so angry that he broke out, and betrayed the secret. In an instant the castle disappeared, and they were back again in their old hut. \"Now you have got what you want,\" said he; \"and we can gnaw at a bare bone again.\" - \"Ah,\" said the woman, \"I had rather not have riches if I am not to know from whom they come, for then I have no peace.\"\n\nThe man went back to fish, and after a while he chanced to draw out the gold fish for a third time. \"Listen,\" said the fish, \"I see very well that I am fated to fall into your hands, take me home and cut me into six pieces; give your wife two of them to eat, two to your horse and bury two of them in the ground, then they will bring you a blessing.\" The fisherman took the fish home with him, and did as it had bidden him. It came to pass, however, that from the two pieces that were buried in the ground two golden lilies sprang up, that the horse had two golden foals, and the fisherman\'s wife bore two children who were made entirely of gold. The children grew up, became tall and handsome, and the lilies and horses grew likewise. Then they said, \"Father, we want to mount our golden steeds and travel out in the world.\" But he answered sorrowfully, \"How shall I bear it if you go away, and I know not how it fares with you?\" Then they said, \"The two golden lilies remain here. By them you can see how it is with us; if they are fresh, then we are in health; if they are withered, we are ill; if they perish, then we are dead.\" So they rode forth and came to an inn, in which were many people, and when they perceived the gold-children they began to laugh, and jeer. When one of them heard the mocking he felt ashamed and would not go out into the world, but turned back and went home again to his father. But the other rode forward and reached a great forest. As he was about to enter it, the people said, It is not safe for you to ride through, the wood is full of robbers who would treat you badly. You will fare ill, and when they see that you are all of gold, and your horse likewise, they will assuredly kill you.\'\n\nBut he would not allow himself to be frightened, and said, \"I must and will ride through it.\" Then he took bear-skins and covered himself and his horse with them, so that the gold was no more to be seen, and rode fearlessly into the forest. When he had ridden onward a little he heard a rustling in the bushes, and heard voices speaking together. From one side came cries of, \"There is one,\" but from the other, \"Let him go, \'tis an idle fellow, as poor and bare as a church-mouse, what should we gain from him?\"\n\nSo the gold-child rode joyfully through the forest, and no evil befell him. One day he entered a village wherein he saw a maiden, who was so beautiful that he did not believe that any more beautiful than she existed in the world. And as such a mighty love took possession of him, he went up to her and said, \"I love thee with my whole heart, wilt thou be my wife?\" He, too, pleased the maiden so much that she agreed and said, \"Yes, I will be thy wife, and be true to thee my whole life long.\" Then they were married, and just as they were in the greatest happiness, home came the father of the bride, and when he saw that his daughter\'s wedding was being celebrated, he was astonished, and said, \"Where is the bridegroom?\" They showed him the gold-child, who, however, still wore his bear-skins. Then the father said wrathfully, \"A vagabond shall never have my daughter!\" and was about to kill him. Then the bride begged as hard as she could, and said, \"He is my husband, and I love him with all my heart!\" until at last he allowed himself to be appeased. Nevertheless the idea never left his thoughts, so that next morning he rose early, wishing to see whether his daughter\'s husband was a common ragged beggar. But when he peeped in, he saw a magnificent golden man in the bed, and the cast-off bear-skins lying on the ground. Then he went back and thought, \"What a good thing it was that I restrained my anger! I should have committed a great crime.\" But the gold-child dreamed that he rode out to hunt a splendid stag, and when he awoke in the morning, he said to his wife, \"I must go out hunting.\" She was uneasy, and begged him to stay there, and said, \"You might easily meet with a great misfortune,\" but he answered, \"I must and will go.\"\n\nThereupon he got up, and rode forth into the forest, and it was not long before a fine stag crossed his path exactly according to his dream. He aimed and was about to shoot it, when the stag ran away. He gave chase over hedges and ditches for the whole day without feeling tired, but in the evening the stag vanished from his sight, and when the gold-child looked round him, he was standing before a little house, wherein was a witch. He knocked, and a little old woman came out and asked, \"What are you doing so late in the midst of the great forest?\" - \"Have you not seen a stag?\" - \"Yes,\" answered she, \"I know the stag well,\" and thereupon a little dog which had come out of the house with her, barked at the man violently. \"Wilt thou be silent, thou odious toad,\" said he, \"or I will shoot thee dead.\" Then the witch cried out in a passion, \"What! will you slay my little dog?\" and immediately transformed him, so that he lay like a stone, and his bride awaited him in vain and thought, \"That which I so greatly dreaded, which lay so heavily on my heart, has come upon him!\" But at home the other brother was standing by the gold-lilies, when one of them suddenly drooped. \"Good heavens!\" said he, \"my brother has met with some great misfortune! I must away to see if I can possibly rescue him.\" Then the father said, \"Stay here, if I lose you also, what shall I do?\" But he answered, \"I must and will go forth!\"\n\nThen he mounted his golden horse, and rode forth and entered the great forest, where his brother lay turned to stone. The old witch came out of her house and called him, wishing to entrap him also, but he did not go near her, and said, \"I will shoot you, if you will not bring my brother to life again.\" She touched the stone, though very unwillingly, with her forefinger, and he was immediately restored to his human shape. But the two gold-children rejoiced when they saw each other again, kissed and caressed each other, and rode away together out of the forest, the one home to his bride, and the other to his father. The father then said, \"I knew well that you had rescued your brother, for the golden lily suddenly rose up and blossomed out again.\" Then they lived happily, and all prospered with them until their death.</string>
    <string name="story342text">In times gone by there was a king who had at the back of his castle a beautiful pleasure-garden, in which stood a tree that bore golden apples. As the apples ripened they were counted, but one morning one was missing. Then the king was angry, and he ordered that watch should be kept about the tree every night.\n\nNow the king had three sons, and he sent the eldest to spend the whole night in the garden; so he watched till midnight, and then he could keep off sleep no longer, and in the morning another apple was missing. The second son had to watch the following night; but it fared no better, for when twelve o\'clock had struck he went to sleep, and in the morning another apple was missing. Now came the turn of the third son to watch, and he was ready to do so; but the king had less trust in him, and believed he would acquit himself still worse than his brothers, but in the end he consented to let him try. So the young man lay down under the tree to watch, and resolved that sleep should not be master.\n\nWhen it struck twelve something came rushing through the air, and he saw in the moonlight a bird flying towards him, whose feathers glittered like gold. The bird perched upon the tree, and had already pecked off an apple, when the young man let fly an arrow at it. The bird flew away, but the arrow had struck its plumage, and one of its golden feathers fell to the ground: the young man picked it up, and taking it next morning to the king, told him what had happened in the night. The king called his council together, and all declared that such a feather was worth more than the whole kingdom. \"Since the feather is so valuable,\" said the king, \"one is not enough for me; I must and will have the whole bird.\"\n\nSo the eldest son set off, and relying on his own cleverness he thought he should soon find the golden bird. When he had gone some distance he saw a fox sitting at the edge of a wood, and he pointed his gun at him. The fox cried out, \"Do not shoot me, and I will give you good counsel. You are on your way to find the golden bird, and this evening you will come to a village, in which two taverns stand facing each other. One will be brightly lighted up, and there will be plenty of merriment going on inside; do not mind about that, but go into the other one, although it will look to you very uninviting.\'\'\n\n\"How can a silly beast give one any rational advice?\" thought the king\'s son and let fly at the fox, but missed him, and he stretched out his tail and ran quick into the wood. Then the young man went on his way, and towards evening he came to the village, and there stood the two taverns; in one singing and dancing was going on, the other looked quite dull and wretched.\n\n\"I should be a fool,\" said he, \"to go into that dismal place, while there is anything so good close by.\" So he went into the merry inn, and there lived in clover, quite forgetting the bird and his father, and all good counsel.\n\nAs time went on, and the eldest son never came home, the second son set out to seek the golden bird. He met with the fox, just as the eldest did, and received good advice from him without attending to it. And when he came to the two taverns, his brother was standing and calling to him at the window of one of them, out of which came sounds of merriment; so he could not resist, but went in and revelled to his heart\'s content.\n\nAnd then, as time went on, the youngest son wished to go forth, and to try his luck, but his father would not consent.\n\n\"It would be useless,\" said he; \"he is much less likely to find the bird than his brothers, and if any misfortune were to happen to him he would not know how to help himself; his wits are none of the best.\" But at last, as there was no peace to be had, he let him go.\n\nBy the side of the wood sat the fox, begged him to spare his life, and gave him good counsel. The young man was kind, and said, \"Be easy, little fox, I will do you no harm.\"\n\n\"You shall not repent of it,\" answered the fox, \"and that you may get there all the sooner, get up and sit on my tail.\" And no sooner had he done so than the fox began to run, and off they went over stock and stone, so that the wind whistled in their hair. When they reached the village the young man got down, and, following the fox\'s advice, went into the mean-looking tavern, without hesitating, and there he passed a quiet night.\n\nThe next morning, when he went out into the field, the fox, who was sitting there already, said, \"I will tell you further what you have to do. Go straight on until you come to a castle, before which a great band of soldiers lie, but do not trouble yourself about them, for they will be all asleep and snoring; pass through them and forward into the castle, and go through all the rooms, until you come to one where there is a golden bird hanging in a wooden cage. Near at hand will stand empty a golden cage of state, but you must beware of taking the bird out of his ugly cage and putting him into the fine one; if you do so you will come to harm.\" After he had finished saying this the fox stretched out his tail again, and the king\'s son sat him down upon it; then away they went over stock and stone, so that the wind whistled through their hair.\n\nAnd when the king\'s son reached the castle he found everything as the fox had said: and he at last entered the room where the golden bird was hanging in a wooden cage, while a golden one was standing by; the three golden apples too were in the room. Then, thinking it foolish to let the beautiful bird stay in that mean and ugly cage, he opened the door of it, took hold of it, and put it in the golden one. In the same moment the bird uttered a piercing cry. The soldiers awaked, rushed in, seized the king\'s son and put him in prison.\n\nThe next morning he was brought before a judge, and, as he confessed everything, condemned to death. But the king said he would spare his life on one condition, that he should bring him the golden horse whose paces were swifter than the wind, and that then he should also receive the golden bird as a reward.\n\nSo the king\'s son set off to find the golden horse, but he sighed, and was very sad, for how should it be accomplished? And then he saw his old friend the fox sitting by the roadside.\n\"Now, you see,\" said the fox, \"ail this has happened, because you would not listen to me. But be of good courage, I will bring you through, and will tell you how you are to get the golden horse. You must go straight on until you come to a castle, where the horse stands in his stable; before the stable-door the grooms will be lying, but they will all be asleep and snoring; and you can go and quietly lead out the horse. But one thing you must mind - take care to put upon him the plain saddle of wood and leather, and not the golden one, which will hang close by; otherwise it will go badly with you.\"\n\nThen the fox stretched out his tail, and the king\'s son seated himself upon it, and away they went over stock and stone until the wind whistled through their hair. And everything happened just as the fox had said, and he came to the stall where the golden horse was: and as he was about to put on him the plain saddle, he thought to himself, \"Such a beautiful animal would be disgraced were I not to put on him the good saddle, which becomes him so well.\" However, no sooner did the horse feel the golden saddle touch him than he began to neigh. And the grooms all awoke, seized the king\'s son and threw him into prison. The next morning he was delivered up to justice and condemned to death, but the king promised him his life, and also to bestow upon him the golden horse, if he could convey thither the beautiful princess of the golden castle.\n\nWith a heavy heart the king\'s son set out, but by great good luck he soon met with the faithful fox. \"I ought now to leave you to your own ill-luck,\" said the fox, \"but I am sorry for you, and will once more help you in your need. Your way lies straight up to the golden castle: you will arrive there in the evening, and at night, when all is quiet, the beautiful princess goes to the bath. And as she is entering the bathing-house, go up to her and give her a kiss, then she will follow you, and you can lead her away; but do not suffer her first to go and take leave of her parents, or it will go ill with you.\" Then the fox stretched out his tail; the king\'s son seated himself upon it, and away they went over stock and stone, so that the wind whistled through their hair.\n\nAnd when he came to the golden castle, all was as the fox had said. He waited until midnight, when all lay in deep sleep, and then as the beautiful princess went to the bathing-house he went up to her and gave her a kiss, and she willingly promised to go with him, but she begged him earnestly, and with tears, that he would let her first go and take leave of her parents. At first he denied her prayer, but as she wept so much the more, and fell at his feet, he gave in at last.\n\nAnd no sooner had the princess reached her father\'s bedside than he, and all who were in the castle, waked up, and the young man was seized and thrown into prison. The next morning the king said to him, \"Thy life is forfeit, but thou shalt find grace if thou canst level that mountain that lies before my windows, and over which I am not able to see: and if this is done within eight days thou shalt have my daughter for a reward.\" So the king\'s son set to work, and dug and shovelled away without ceasing, but when, on the seventh day, he saw how little he had accomplished, and that all his work was as nothing, be fell into great sadness, and gave up all hope.\n\nBut on the evening of the seventh day the fox appeared, and said, \"You do not deserve that I should help you, but go now and lie down to sleep, and I will do the work for you.\" The next morning when he awoke, and looked out of the window, the mountain had disappeared. The young man hastened full of joy to the king, and told him that his behest was fulfilled, and, whether the king liked it or not, he had to keep to his word, and let his daughter go. So they both went away together, and it was not long before the faithful fox came up to them.\n\n\"Well, you have got the best first,\" said he; \"but you must know the golden, horse belongs to the princess of the golden castle.\" - \"But how shall I get it?\" asked the young man. \"I am going to tell you,\" answered the fox. \"First, go to the king who sent you to the golden castle, and take to him the beautiful princess. There will then be very great rejoicing; he will willingly give you the golden horse, and they will lead him out to you; then mount him without delay, and stretch out your hand to each of them to take leave, and last of all to the princess, and when you have her by the hand swing her up on the horse behind you, and off you go! nobody will be able to overtake you, for that horse goes swifter than the wind.\"\n\nAnd so it was all happily done, and the king\'s son carried off the beautiful princess on the golden horse. The fox did not stay behind, and he said to the young man, \"Now, I will help you to get the golden bird. When you draw near the castle where the bird is, let the lady alight, and I will take her under my care; then you must ride the golden horse into the castle-yard, and there will be great rejoicing to see it, and they will bring out to you the golden bird; as soon as you have the cage in your hand, you must start off back to us, and then you shall carry the lady away.\" The plan was successfully carried out; and when the young man returned with the treasure, the fox said, \"Now, what will you give me for my reward?\" - \"What would you like?\" asked the young man. \"When we are passing through the wood, I desire that you should slay me, and cut my head and feet off.\"\n\n\"That were a strange sign of gratitude,\" said the king\'s son, \"and I could not possibly do such a thing.\" Then said the fox, \"If you will not do it, I must leave you; but before I go let me give you some good advice. Beware of two things: buy no gallows-meat, and sit at no brook-side.\" With that the fox ran off into the wood.\n\nThe young man thought to himself, \"That is a wonderful animal, with most singular ideas. How should any one buy gallows-meat? and I am sure I have no particular fancy for sitting by a brook-side.\" So he rode on with the beautiful princess, and their way led them through the village where his two brothers had stayed. There they heard great outcry and noise, and when he asked what it was all about, they told him that two people were going to be hanged. And when he drew near he saw that it was his two brothers, who had done all sorts of evil tricks, and had wasted all their goods. He asked if there were no means of setting them free.\n\n\"Oh yes! if you will buy them off,\" answered the people; \"but why should you spend your money in redeeming such worthless men?\" But he persisted in doing so; and when they were let go they all went on their journey together.\n\nAfter a while they came to the wood where the fox had met them first, and there it seemed so cool and sheltered from the sun\'s burning rays that the two brothers said, \"Let us rest here for a little by the brook, and eat and drink to refresh ourselves.\" The young man consented, quite forgetting the fox\'s warning, and he seated himself by the brook-side, suspecting no evil. But the two brothers thrust him backwards into the brook, seized the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went home to their father.\n\n\"Is not this the golden bird that we bring?\" said they; \"and we have also the golden horse, and the princess of the golden castle.\" Then there was great rejoicing in the royal castle, but the horse did not, feed, the bird did not chirp, and the princess sat still and wept.\n\nThe youngest brother, however, had not perished. The brook was, by good fortune, dry, and he fell on soft moss without receiving any hurt, but he could not get up again. But in his need the faithful fox was not lacking; he came up running, and reproached him for having forgotten his advice.\n\n\"But I cannot forsake you all the same,\" said he; \"I will help you back again into daylight.\" So he told the young man to grasp his tail, and hold on to it fast, and so he drew him up again. \"Still you are not quite out of all danger,\" said the fox; \"your brothers, not being certain of your death, have surrounded the wood with sentinels, who are to put you to death if you let yourself be seen.\" A poor beggar-man was sitting by the path, and the young man changed clothes with him, and went clad in that wise into the king\'s courtyard. Nobody knew him, but the bird began to chirp, and the horse began to feed, and the beautiful princess ceased weeping.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" said the king, astonished. The princess answered, \"I cannot tell, except that I was sad, and now I am joyful; it is to me as if my rightful bridegroom had returned.\" Then she told him all that happened, although the two brothers had threatened to put her to death if she let out anything.\n\nThe king then ordered every person who was in the castle to be brought before him, and with the rest came the young man like a beggar in his wretched garments; but the princess knew him, and greeted him well, falling on his neck and kissing him. The wicked brothers were seized and put to death, and the youngest brother was married to the princess, and succeeded to the inheritance of his father.\n\nBut what became of the poor fox? Long afterwards the king\'s son was going through the wood, and the fox met him and said, \"Now, you have everything that you can wish for, but my misfortunes never come to an end, and it lies in your power to free me from them.\" And once more he prayed the king\'s son earnestly to slay him, and cut off his head and feet. So, at last, he consented, and no sooner was it done than the fox was changed into a man, and was no other than the brother of the beautiful princess; and thus he was set free from a spell that had bound him for a long, long time. And now, indeed, there lacked nothing to their happiness as long as they lived.</string>
    <string name="story343text">There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called the Simpleton, and was despised, laughed at, and neglected, on every occasion. It happened one day that the eldest son wished to go into the forest to cut wood, and before he went his mother gave him a delicious pancake and a flask of wine, that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst. When he came into the forest a little old grey man met him, who wished him good day, and said, \"Give me a bit of cake out of your pocket, and let me have a drink of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.\" But the prudent youth answered, \"Give you my cake and my wine? I haven\'t got any; be off with you.\" And leaving the little man standing there, he went off. Then he began to fell a tree, but he had not been at it long before he made a wrong stroke, and the hatchet hit him in the arm, so that he was obliged to go home and get it bound up. That was what came of the little grey man.\n\nAfterwards the second son went into the wood, and the mother gave to him, as to the eldest, a pancake and a flask of wine. The little old grey man met him also, and begged for a little bit of cake and a drink of wine. But the second son spoke out plainly, saying, \"What I give you I lose myself, so be off with you.\" And leaving the little man standing there, he went off. The punishment followed; as he was chopping away at the tree, he hit himself in the leg so severely that he had to be carried home.\n\nThen said the Simpleton, \"Father, let me go for once into the forest to cut wood; and the father answered, \"Your brothers have hurt themselves by so doing; give it up, you understand nothing about it.\" But the Simpleton went on begging so long, that the father said at last, \"Well, be off with you; you will only learn by experience.\" The mother gave him a cake (it was only made with water, and baked in the ashes), and with it a flask of sour beer. When he came into the forest the little old grey man met him, and greeted him, saying, \"Give me a bit of your cake, and a drink from your flask; I am so hungry and thirsty.\" And the Simpleton answered, \"I have only a flour and water cake and sour beer; but if that is good enough for you, let us sit down together and eat.\" Then they sat down, and as the Simpleton took out his flour and water cake it became a rich pancake, and his sour beer became good wine; then they ate and drank, and afterwards the little man said, \"As you have such a kind heart, and share what you have so willingly, I will bestow good luck upon you. Yonder stands an old tree; cut it down, and at its roots you will find some thing,\" and thereupon the little man took his departure.\n\nThe Simpleton went there, and hewed away at the tree, and when it fell he saw, sitting among the roots, a goose with feathers of pure gold. He lifted it out and took it with him to an inn where he intended to stay the night. The landlord had three daughters who, when they saw the goose, were curious to know what wonderful kind of bird it was, and ended by longing for one of its golden feathers. The eldest thought, \"I will wait for a good opportunity, and then I will pull out one of its feathers for myself;\" and so, when the Simpleton was gone out, she seized the goose by its wing - but there her finger and hand had to stay, held fast. Soon after came the second sister with the same idea of plucking out one of the golden feathers for herself; but scarcely had she touched her sister, than she also was obliged to stay, held fast. Lastly came the third with the same intentions; but the others screamed out, \"Stay away! for heaven\'s sake stay away!\" But she did not see why she should stay away, and thought, \"If they do so, why should not I?\" and went towards them. But when she reached her sisters there she stopped, hanging on with them. And so they had to stay, all night.\n\nThe next morning the Simpleton took the goose under his arm and went away, unmindful of the three girls that hung on to it. The three had always to run after him, left and right, wherever his legs carried him. In the midst of the fields they met the parson, who, when he saw the procession, said, \"Shame on you, girls, running after a young fellow through the fields like this,\" and forthwith he seized hold of the youngest by the hand to drag her away, but hardly had he touched her when he too was obliged to run after them himself. Not long after the sexton came that way, and seeing the respected parson following at the heels of the three girls, he called out, \"Ho, your reverence, whither away so quickly? You forget that we have another christening to-day,\" and he seized hold of him by his gown; but no sooner had he touched him than he was obliged to follow on too. As the five tramped on, one after another, two peasants with their hoes came up from the fields, and the parson cried out to them, and begged them to come and set him and the sexton free, but no sooner had they touched the sexton than they had to follow on too; and now there were seven following the Simpleton and the goose.\n\nBy and by they came to a town where a king reigned, who had an only daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh; therefore the king had given out that whoever should make her laugh should have her in marriage. The Simpleton, when he heard this, went with his goose and his hangers-on into the presence of the king\'s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people following always one after the other, she burst out laughing, and seemed as if she could never stop.\n\nAnd so the Simpleton earned a right to her as his bride; but the king did not like him for a son-in-law and made all kinds of objections, and said he must first bring a man who could drink up a whole cellar of wine. The Simpleton thought that the little grey man would be able to help him, and went out into the forest, and there, on the very spot where he felled the tree, he saw a man sitting with a very sad countenance. The Simpleton asked him what was the matter, and he answered, \"I have a great thirst, which I cannot quench: cold water does not agree with me; I have indeed drunk up a whole cask of wine, but what good is a drop like that?\" Then said the Simpleton, \"I can help you; only come with me, and you shall have enough.\" He took him straight to the king\'s cellar, and the man sat himself down before the big vats, and drank, and drank, and before a day was over he had drunk up the whole cellar-full.\n\nThe Simpleton again asked for his bride, but the king was annoyed that a wretched fellow, called the Simpleton by everybody, should carry off his daughter, and so he made new conditions. He was to produce a man who could eat up a mountain of bread. The Simpleton did not hesitate long, but ran quickly off to the forest, and there in the same place sat a man who had fastened a strap round his body, making a very piteous face, and saying, \"I have eaten a whole bakehouse full of rolls, but what is the use of that when one is so hungry as I am? My stomach feels quite empty, and I am obliged to strap myself together, that I may not die of hunger.\" The Simpleton was quite glad of this, and said, \"Get up quickly, and come along with me, and you shall have enough to eat.\" He led him straight to the king\'s courtyard, where all the meal in the kingdom had been collected and baked into a mountain of bread. The man out of the forest settled himself down before it and hastened to eat, and in one day the whole mountain had disappeared. Then the Simpleton asked for his bride the third time. The king, however, found one more excuse, and said he must have a ship that should be able to sail on land or on water. \"So soon,\" said he, \"as you come sailing along with it, you shall have my daughter for your wife.\" The Simpleton went straight to the forest, and there sat the little old grey man with whom he had shared his cake, and he said, \"I have eaten for you, and I have drunk for you, I will also give you the ship; and all because you were kind to me at the first.\" Then he gave him the ship that could sail on land and on water, and when the king saw it he knew he could no longer withhold his daughter.\n\nThe marriage took place immediately, and at the death of the king the Simpleton possessed the kingdom, and lived long and happily with his wife.</string>
    <string name="story344text">In the winter time, when deep snow lay on the ground, a poor boy was forced to go out on a sledge to fetch wood. When he had gathered it together, and packed it, he wished, as he was so frozen with cold, not to go home at once, but to light a fire and warm himself a little. So he scraped away the snow, and as he was thus clearing the ground, he found a tiny, gold key. Hereupon he thought that where the key was, the lock must be also, and dug in the ground and found an iron chest. If the key does but fit it! thought he, no doubt there are precious things in that little box. He searched, but no keyhole was there. At last he discovered one, but so small that it was hardly visible. He tried it, and the key fitted it exactly. Then he turned it once round, and now we must wait until he has quite unlocked it and opened the lid, and then we shall learn what wonderful things were lying in that box.</string>
    <string name="story346text">There lived once an old Queen, whose husband had been dead many years. She had a beautiful daughter who was promised in marriage to a King\'s son living a great way off. When the time appointed for the wedding drew near, and the old Queen had to send her daughter into the foreign land, she got together many costly things, furniture and cups and jewels and adornments, both of gold and silver, everything proper for the dowry of a royal Princess, for she loved her daughter dearly. She gave her also a waiting gentlewoman to attend her and to give her into the bridegroom\'s hands; and they were each to have a horse for the journey, and the Princess\'s horse was named Falada, and he could speak. When the time for parting came, the old Queen took her daughter to her chamber, and with a little knife she cut her own finger so that it bled; and she held beneath it a white napkin, and on it fell three drops of blood; and she gave it to her daughter, bidding her take care of it, for it would be needful to her on the way.\n\nThen they took leave of each other; and the Princess put the napkin in her bosom, got on her horse, and set out to go to the bridegroom. After she had ridden an hour, she began to feel very thirsty, and she said to the waiting-woman, \"Get down, and fill my cup that you are carrying with water from the brook; I have great desire to drink.\" - \"Get down yourself,\" said the waiting-woman, \"and if you are thirsty stoop down and drink; I will not be your slave.\" And as her thirst was so great, the Princess had to get down and to stoop and drink of the water of the brook, and could not have her gold cup to serve her. \"Oh dear!\" said the poor Princess. And the three drops of blood heard her, and said, \"If your mother knew of this, it would break her heart.\" But the Princess answered nothing, and quietly mounted her horse again. So they rode on some miles farther; the day was warm, the sun shone hot, and the Princess grew thirsty once more. And when they came to a water-course she called again to the waiting-woman and said, \"Get down, and give me to drink out of my golden cup.\" For she had forgotten all that had gone before. But the waiting-woman spoke still more scornfully and said, \"If you want a drink, you may get it yourself; I am not going to be your slave.\" So, as her thirst was so great, the Princess had to get off her horse and to stoop towards the running water to drink, and as she stooped, she wept and said, \"Oh dear!\" And the three drops of blood heard her and answered, \"If your mother knew of this, it would break her heart!\" And as she drank and stooped over, the napkin on which were the three drops of blood fell out of her bosom and floated down the stream, and in her distress she never noticed it; not so the waiting-woman, who rejoiced because she should have power over the bride, who, now that she had lost the three drops of blood, had become weak, and unable to defend herself. And when she was going to mount her horse again the waiting-woman cried, \"Falada belongs to me, and this jade to you.\" And the Princess had to give way and let it be as she said. Then the waiting-woman ordered the Princess with many hard words to take off her rich clothing and to put on her plain garments, and then she made her swear to say nothing of the matter when they came to the royal court; threatening to take her life if she refused. And all the while Falada noticed and remembered.\n\nThe waiting-woman then mounting Falada, and the Princess the sorry jade, they journeyed on till they reached the royal castle. There was great joy at their coming, and the King\'s son hastened to meet them, and lifted the waiting woman from her horse, thinking she was his bride; and then he led her up the stairs, while the real Princess had to remain below. But the old King, who was looking out of the window, saw her standing in the yard, and noticed how delicate and gentle and beautiful she was, and then he went down and asked the seeming bride who it was that she had brought with her and that was now standing in the courtyard.\n\n\"Oh!\" answered the bride, \"I only brought her with me for company; give the maid something to do, that she may not be for ever standing idle.\" But the old King had no work to give her; until he bethought him of a boy he had who took care of the geese, and that she might help him. And so the real Princess was sent to keep geese with the goose-boy, who was called Conrad.\n\nSoon after the false bride said to the Prince, \"Dearest husband, I pray thee do me a pleasure.\" - \"With all my heart,\" answered he. \"Then \"said she, \"send for the knacker, that he may carry off the horse I came here upon, and make away with him; he was very troublesome to me on the journey.\" For she was afraid that the horse might tell how she had behaved to the Princess. And when the order had been given that Falada should die, it came to the Princess\'s ears, and she came to the knacker\'s man secretly, and promised him a piece of gold if he would do her a service. There was in the town a great dark gate-way through which she had to pass morning and evening with her geese, and she asked the man to take Falada\'s head and to nail it on the gate, that she might always see it as she passed by. And the man promised, and he took Falada\'s head and nailed it fast in the dark gate-way.\n\nEarly next morning as she and Conrad drove their geese through the gate, she said as she went by:\n\"O Falada, dost thou hang there?\"\nAnd the head answered:\n\n\"Princess, dost thou so meanly fare?\nBut if thy mother knew thy pain,\nHer heart would surely break in twain.\"\n\nBut she went on through the town, driving her geese to the field. And when they came into the meadows, she sat down and undid her hair, which was all of gold, and when Conrad saw how it glistened, he wanted to pull out a few hairs for himself. And she said:\n\n\"O wind, blow Conrad\'s hat away,\nMake him run after as it flies,\nWhile I with my gold hair will play,\nAnd twist it up\nin seemly wise.\"\n\nThen there came a wind strong enough to blow Conrad\'s hat far away over the fields, and he had to run after it; and by the time he came back she had put up her hair with combs and pins, and he could not get at any to pull it out; and he was sulky and would not speak to her; so they looked after the geese until the evening came, and then they went home.\n\nThe next morning, as they passed under the dark gate-way, the Princess said:\n\n\"O Falada, dost thou hang there?\"\nAnd Falada answered:\n\"Princess, dost thou so meanly fare?\nBut if thy mother knew thy pain,\nHer heart would surely break in twain.\"\n\nAnd when they reached the fields she sat down and began to comb out her hair; then Conrad came up and wanted to seize upon some of it, and she cried:\n\n\"O wind, blow Conrad\'s hat away,\nMake him run after as it flies,\nWhile I with my gold hair will play,\nAnd do it up\nin seemly wise.\"\n\nThen the wind came and blew Conrad\'s hat very far away, so that he had to run after it, and when he came back again her hair was put up again, so that he could pull none of it out; and they tended the geese until the evening.\n\nAnd after they had got home, Conrad went to the old King and said: \"I will tend the geese no longer with that girl!\" - \"Why not?\" asked the old King. \"Because she vexes me the whole day long,\" answered Conrad. Then the old King ordered him to tell how it was. \"Every morning,\" said Conrad, \"as we pass under the dark gate-way with the geese, there is an old horse\'s head hanging on the wall, and she says to it:\n\n\'O Falada, dost thou hang there?\'\nAnd the head answers:\n\'Princess, dost thou so meanly fare?\nBut if thy mother knew thy pain,\nHer heart would surely break in twain.\'\"\n\nAnd besides this, Conrad related all that happened in the fields, and how he was obliged to run after his hat.\n\nThe old King told him to go to drive the geese next morning as usual, and he himself went behind the gate and listened how the maiden spoke to Falada; and then he followed them into the fields, and hid himself behind a bush; and he watched the goose-boy and the goose-girl tend the geese; and after a while he saw the girl make her hair all loose, and how it gleamed and shone. Soon she said:\n\n\"O wind, blow Conrad\'s hat away,\nAnd make him follow as it flies,\nWhile I with my gold hair will play,\nAnd bind it up\nin seemly wise.\"\n\nThen there came a gust of wind and away went Conrad\'s hat, and he after it, while the maiden combed and bound up her hair; and the old King saw all that went on. At last he went unnoticed away, and when the goose-girl came back in the evening he sent for her, and asked the reason of her doing all this. \"That I dare not tell you,\" she answered, \"nor can I tell any man of my woe, for when I was in danger of my life I swore an oath not to reveal it.\" And he pressed her sore, and left her no peace, but he could get nothing out of her. At last he said, \"If you will not tell it me, tell it to the iron oven,\" and went away. Then she crept into the iron oven, and began to weep and to lament, and at last she opened her heart and said, \"Here I sit forsaken of all the world, and I am a King\'s daughter, and a wicked waiting-woman forced me to give up my royal garments and my place at the bridegroom\'s side, and I am made a goose-girl, and have to do mean service. And if my mother knew, it would break her heart.\" Now the old King was standing outside by the oven-door listening, and he heard all she said, and he called to her and told her to come out of the oven. And he caused royal clothing to be put upon her, and it was a marvel to see how beautiful she was. The old King then called his son and proved to him that he had the wrong bride, for she was really only a waiting-woman, and that the true bride was here at hand, she who had been the goose-girl. The Prince was glad at heart when he saw her beauty and gentleness; and a great feast was made ready, and all the court people and good friends were bidden to it. The bridegroom sat in the midst with the Princess on one side and the waiting-woman on the other; and the false bride did not know the true one, because she was dazzled with her glittering braveries. When all the company had eaten and drunk and were merry, the old King gave the waiting-woman a question to answer, as to what such an one deserved, who had deceived her masters in such and such a manner, telling the whole story, and ending by asking, \"Now, what doom does such an one deserve?\" - \"No better than this,\" answered the false bride, \"that she be put naked into a cask, studded inside with sharp nails, and be dragged along in it by two white horses from street to street, until she be dead.\" - \"Thou hast spoken thy own doom,\" said the old King, \"as thou hast said, so shall it be done.\" And when the sentence was fulfilled, the Prince married the true bride, and ever after they ruled over their kingdom in peace and blessedness.</string>
    <string name="story347text">There was once upon a time a very old woman, who lived with he flock of geese in a waste place among the mountains, and there had a little house. The waste was surrounded by a large forest, and every morning the old woman took her crutch and hobbled into it. There, however, the dame was quite active, more so than any one would have thought, considering her age, and collected grass for her geese, picked all the wild fruit she could reach, and carried everything home on her back. Any one would have thought that the heavy load would have weighed her to the ground, but she always brought it safely home. If any one met her, she greeted him quite courteously. \"Good day, dear countryman, it is a fine day. Ah! you wonder that I should drag grass about, but every one must take his burthen on his back.\" Nevertheless, people did not like to meet her if they could help it, and took by preference a round-about way, and when a father with his boys passed her, he whispered to them, \"Beware of the old woman. She has claws beneath her gloves; she is a witch.\"\n\nOne morning, a handsome young man was going through the forest. The sun shone bright, the birds sang, a cool breeze crept through the leaves, and he was full of joy and gladness. He had as yet met no one, when he suddenly perceived the old witch kneeling on the ground cutting grass with a sickle. She had already thrust a whole load into her cloth, and near it stood two baskets, which were filled with wild apples and pears. \"But, good little mother,\" said he, \"how canst thou carry all that away?\" - \"I must carry it, dear sir,\" answered she, \"rich folk\'s children have no need to do such things, but with the peasant folk the saying goes,\nDon\'t look behind you,\nYou will only see how crooked your back is!\"\n\"Will you help me?\" she said, as he remained standing by her. \"You have still a straight back and young legs, it would be a trifle to you. Besides, my house is not so very far from here, it stands there on the heath behind the hill. How soon you would bound up thither.\" The young man took compassion on the old woman. \"My father is certainly no peasant,\" replied he, \"but a rich count; nevertheless, that you may see that it is not only peasants who can carry things, I will take your bundle.\" If you will try it,\" said she, \"I shall be very glad. You will certainly have to walk for an hour, but what will that signify to you; only you must carry the apples and pears as well?\" It now seemed to the young man just a little serious, when he heard of an hour\'s walk, but the old woman would not let him off, packed the bundle on his back, and hung the two baskets on his arm. \"See, it is quite light,\" said she. \"No, it is not light,\" answered the count, and pulled a rueful face. \"Verily, the bundle weighs as heavily as if it were full of cobble stones, and the apples and pears are as heavy as lead! I can scarcely breathe.\" He had a mind to put everything down again, but the old woman would not allow it. \"Just look,\" said she mockingly, \"the young gentleman will not carry what I, an old woman, have so often dragged along. You are ready with fine words, but when it comes to be earnest, you want to take to your heels. Why are you standing loitering there?\" she continued. \"Step out. No one will take the bundle off again.\" As long as he walked on level ground, it was still bearable, but when they came to the hill and had to climb, and the stones rolled down under his feet as if they were alive, it was beyond his strength. The drops of perspiration stood on his forehead, and ran, hot and cold, down his back. \"Dame,\" said he, \"I can go no farther. I want to rest a little.\" - \"Not here,\" answered the old woman, \"when we have arrived at our journey\'s end, you can rest; but now you must go forward. Who knows what good it may do you?\" - \"Old woman, thou art becoming shameless!\" said the count, and tried to throw off the bundle, but he laboured in vain; it stuck as fast to his back as if it grew there. He turned and twisted, but he could not get rid of it. The old woman laughed at this, and sprang about quite delighted on her crutch. \"Don\'t get angry, dear sir,\" said she, \"you are growing as red in the face as a turkey-cock! Carry your bundle patiently. I will give you a good present when we get home.\" What could he do. He was obliged to submit to his fate, and crawl along patiently behind the old woman. She seemed to grow more and more nimble, and his burden still heavier. All at once she made a spring, jumped on to the bundle and seated herself on the top of it; and however withered she might be, she was yet heavier than the stoutest country lass. The youth\'s knees trembled, but when he did not go on, the old woman hit him about the legs with a switch and with stinging-nettles. Groaning continually, he climbed the mountain, and at length reached the old woman\'s house, when he was just about to drop. When the geese perceived the old woman, they flapped their wings, stretched out their necks, ran to meet her, cackling all the while. Behind the flock walked, stick in hand, an old wench, strong and big, but ugly as night. \"Good mother,\" said she to the old woman, \"has anything happened to you, you have stayed away so long?\" - \"By no means, my dear daughter,\" answered she, I have met with nothing bad, but, on the contrary, with this kind gentleman, who has carried my burthen for me; only think, he even took me on his back when I was tired. The way, too, has not seemed long to us; we have been merry, and have been cracking jokes with each other all the time.\" At last the old woman slid down, took the bundle off the young man\'s back, and the baskets from his arm, looked at him quite kindly, and said, \"Now seat yourself on the bench before the door, and rest. You have fairly earned your wages, and they shall not be wanting.\" Then she said to the goose-girl, \"Go into the house, my dear daughter, it is not becoming for thee to be alone with a young gentleman; one must not pour oil on to the fire, he might fall in love with thee.\" The count knew not whether to laugh or to cry. \"Such a sweetheart as that,\" thought he, \"could not touch my heart, even if she were thirty years younger.\" In the meantime the old woman stroked and fondled her geese as if they were children, and then went into the house with her daughter. The youth lay down on the bench, under a wild apple-tree. The air was warm and mild; on all sides stretched a green meadow, which was set with cowslips, wild thyme, and a thousand other flowers; through the midst of it rippled a clear brook on which the sun sparkled, and the white geese went walking backwards and forwards, or paddled in the water. \"It is quite delightful here,\" said he, \"but I am so tired that I cannot keep my eyes open; I will sleep a little. If only a gust of wind does not come and blow my legs off my body, for they are as rotten as tinder.\"\n\nWhen he had slept a little while, the old woman came and shook him till he awoke. \"Sit up,\" said she, \"thou canst not stay here; I have certainly treated thee hardly, still it has not cost thee thy life. Of money and land thou hast no need, here is something else for thee.\" Thereupon she thrust a little book into his hand, which was cut out of a single emerald. \"Take great care of it,\" said she, \"it will bring thee good fortune.\" The count sprang up, and as he felt that he was quite fresh, and had recovered his vigor, he thanked the old woman for her present, and set off without even once looking back at the beautiful daughter. When he was already some way off, he still heard in the distance the noisy cry of the geese.\n\nFor three days the count had to wander in the wilderness before he could find his way out. He then reached a large town, and as no one knew him, he was led into the royal palace, where the King and Queen were sitting on their throne. The count fell on one knee, drew the emerald book out of his pocket, and laid it at the Queen\'s feet. She bade him rise and hand her the little book. Hardly, however, had she opened it, and looked therein, than she fell as if dead to the ground. The count was seized by the King\'s servants, and was being led to prison, when the Queen opened her eyes, and ordered them to release him, and every one was to go out, as she wished to speak with him in private.\n\nWhen the Queen was alone, she began to weep bitterly, and said, \"Of what use to me are the splendours and honours with which I am surrounded; every morning I awake in pain and sorrow. I had three daughters, the youngest of whom was so beautiful that the whole world looked on her as a wonder. She was as white as snow, as rosy as apple-blossom, and her hair as radiant as sun-beams. When she cried, not tears fell from her eyes, but pearls and jewels only. When she was fifteen years old, the King summoned all three sisters to come before his throne. You should have seen how all the people gazed when the youngest entered, it was just as if the sun were rising! Then the King spoke, \'My daughters, I know not when my last day may arrive; I will to-day decide what each shall receive at my death. You all love me, but the one of you who loves me best, shall fare the best.\' Each of them said she loved him best. \'Can you not express to me,\' said the King, \'how much you do love me, and thus I shall see what you mean?\' The eldest spoke, \'I love my father as dearly as the sweetest sugar.\' The second, \'I love my father as dearly as my prettiest dress.\' But the youngest was silent. Then the father said, \'And thou, my dearest child, how much dost thou love me?\' - \'I do not know, and can compare my love with nothing.\' But her father insisted that she should name something. So she said at last, \'The best food does not please me without salt, therefore I love my father like salt.\' When the King heard that, he fell into a passion, and said, \'If thou lovest me like salt, thy love shall also be repaid thee with salt.\' Then he divided the kingdom between the two elder, but caused a sack of salt to be bound on the back of the youngest, and two servants had to lead her forth into the wild forest. We all begged and prayed for her,\" said the Queen, \"but the King\'s anger was not to be appeased. How she cried when she had to leave us! The whole road was strewn with the pearls which flowed from her eyes. The King soon afterwards repented of his great severity, and had the whole forest searched for the poor child, but no one could find her. When I think that the wild beasts have devoured her, I know not how to contain myself for sorrow; many a time I console myself with the hope that she is still alive, and may have hidden herself in a cave, or has found shelter with compassionate people. But picture to yourself, when I opened your little emerald book, a pearl lay therein, of exactly the same kind as those which used to fall from my daughter\'s eyes; and then you can also imagine how the sight of it stirred my heart. You must tell me how you came by that pearl.\" The count told her that he had received it from the old woman in the forest, who had appeared very strange to him, and must be a witch, but he had neither seen nor hear anything of the Queen\'s child. The King and the Queen resolved to seek out the old woman. They thought that there where the pearl had been, they would obtain news of their daughter.\n\nThe old woman was sitting in that lonely place at her spinning-wheel, spinning. It was already dusk, and a log which was burning on the hearth gave a scanty light. All at once there was a noise outside, the geese were coming home from the pasture, and uttering their hoarse cries. Soon afterwards the daughter also entered. But the old woman scarcely thanked her, and only shook her head a little. The daughter sat down beside her, took her spinning-wheel, and twisted the threads as nimbly as a young girl. Thus they both sat for two hours, and exchanged never a word. At last something rustled at the window, and two fiery eyes peered in. It was an old night-owl, which cried, \"Uhu!\" three times. The old woman looked up just a little, then she said, \"Now, my little daughter, it is time for thee to go out and do thy work.\"\n\nShe rose and went out, and where did she go? Over the meadows ever onward into the valley. At last she came to a well, with three old oak-trees standing beside it; meanwhile the moon had risen large and round over the mountain, and it was so light that one could have found a needle. She removed a skin which covered her face, then bent down to the well, and began to wash herself. When she had finished, she dipped the skin also in the water, and then laid it on the meadow, so that it should bleach in the moonlight, and dry again. But how the maiden was changed! Such a change as that was never seen before! When the gray mask fell off, her golden hair broke forth like sunbeams, and spread about like a mantle over her whole form. Her eyes shone out as brightly as the stars in heaven, and her cheeks bloomed a soft red like apple-blossom.\n\nBut the fair maiden was sad. She sat down and wept bitterly. One tear after another forced itself out of her eyes, and rolled through her long hair to the ground. There she sat, and would have remained sitting a long time, if there had not been a rustling and cracking in the boughs of the neighbouring tree. She sprang up like a roe which has been overtaken by the shot of the hunter. Just then the moon was obscured by a dark cloud, and in an instant the maiden had put on the old skin and vanished, like a light blown out by the wind.\n\nShe ran back home, trembling like an aspen-leaf. The old woman was standing on the threshold, and the girl was about to relate what had befallen her, but the old woman laughed kindly, and said, \"I already know all.\" She led her into the room and lighted a new log. She did not, however, sit down to her spinning again, but fetched a broom and began to sweep and scour, \"All must be clean and sweet,\" she said to the girl. \"But, mother,\" said the maiden, \"why do you begin work at so late an hour? What do you expect?\" - \"Dost thou know then what time it is?\" asked the old woman. \"Not yet midnight,\" answered the maiden, \"but already past eleven o\'clock.\" - \"Dost thou not remember,\" continued the old woman, \"that it is three years to-day since thou camest to me? Thy time is up, we can no longer remain together.\" The girl was terrified, and said, \"Alas! dear mother, will you cast me off? Where shall I go? I have no friends, and no home to which I can go. I have always done as you bade me, and you have always been satisfied with me; do not send me away.\" The old woman would not tell the maiden what lay before her. \"My stay here is over,\" she said to her, \"but when I depart, house and parlour must be clean: therefore do not hinder me in my work. Have no care for thyself, thou shalt find a roof to shelter thee, and the wages which I will give thee shall also content thee.\" - \"But tell me what is about to happen,\" the maiden continued to entreat. \"I tell thee again, do not hinder me in my work. Do not say a word more, go to thy chamber, take the skin off thy face, and put on the silken gown which thou hadst on when thou camest to me, and then wait in thy chamber until I call thee.\"\n\nBut I must once more tell of the King and Queen, who had journeyed forth with the count in order to seek out the old woman in the wilderness. The count had strayed away from them in the wood by night, and had to walk onwards alone. Next day it seemed to him that he was on the right track. He still went forward, until darkness came on, then he climbed a tree, intending to pass the night there, for he feared that he might lose his way. When the moon illumined the surrounding country he perceived a figure coming down the mountain. She had no stick in her hand, but yet he could see that it was the goose-girl, whom he had seen before in the house of the old woman. \"Oho,\" cried he, \"there she comes, and if I once get hold of one of the witches, the other shall not escape me!\" But how astonished he was, when she went to the well, took off the skin and washed herself, when her golden hair fell down all about her, and she was more beautiful than any one whom he had ever seen in the whole world. He hardly dared to breathe, but stretched his head as far forward through the leaves as he dared, and stared at her. Either he bent over too far, or whatever the cause might be, the bough suddenly cracked, and that very moment the maiden slipped into the skin, sprang away like a roe, and as the moon was suddenly covered, disappeared from his eyes.\n\nHardly had she disappeared, before the count descended from the tree, and hastened after her with nimble steps. He had not been gone long before he saw, in the twilight, two figures coming over the meadow. It was the King and Queen, who had perceived from a distance the light shining in the old woman\'s little house, and were going to it. The count told them what wonderful things he had seen by the well, and they did not doubt that it had been their lost daughter. They walked onwards full of joy, and soon came to the little house. The geese were sitting all round it, and had thrust their heads under their wings and were sleeping, and not one of them moved. The King and Queen looked in at the window, the old woman was sitting there quite quietly spinning, nodding her head and never looking round. The room was perfectly clean, as if the little mist men, who carry no dust on their feet, lived there. Their daughter, however, they did not see. They gazed at all this for a long time, at last they took heart, and knocked softly at the window. The old woman appeared to have been expecting them; she rose, and called out quite kindly, \"Come in, I know you already.\" When they had entered the room, the old woman said, \"You might have spared yourself the long walk, if you had not three years ago unjustly driven away your child, who is so good and lovable. No harm has come to her; for three years she has had to tend the geese; with them she has learnt no evil, but has preserved her purity of heart. You, however, have been sufficiently punished by the misery in which you have lived.\" Then she went to the chamber and called, \"Come out, my little daughter.\" Thereupon the door opened, and the princess stepped out in her silken garments, with her golden hair and her shining eyes, and it was as if an angel from heaven had entered.\n\nShe went up to her father and mother, fell on their necks and kissed them; there was no help for it, they all had to weep for joy. The young count stood near them, and when she perceived him she became as red in the face as a moss-rose, she herself did not know why. The King said, \"My dear child, I have given away my kingdom, what shall I give thee?\" - \"She needs nothing,\" said the old woman. \"I give her the tears that she has wept on your account; they are precious pearls, finer than those that are found in the sea, and worth more than your whole kingdom, and I give her my little house as payment for her services.\" When the old woman had said that, she disappeared from their sight. The walls rattled a little, and when the King and Queen looked round, the little house had changed into a splendid palace, a royal table had been spread, and the servants were running hither and thither.\n\nThe story goes still further, but my grandmother, who related it to me, had partly lost her memory, and had forgotten the rest. I shall always believe that the beautiful princess married the count, and that they remained together in the palace, and lived there in all happiness so long as God willed it. Whether the snow-white geese, which were kept near the little hut, were verily young maidens (no one need take offence), whom the old woman had taken under her protection, and whether they now received their human form again, and stayed as handmaids to the young Queen, I do not exactly know, but I suspect it. This much is certain, that the old woman was no witch, as people thought, but a wise woman, who meant well. Very likely it was she who, at the princess\'s birth, gave her the gift of weeping pearls instead of tears. That does not happen now-a-days, or else the poor would soon become rich.</string>
    <string name="story348text">The she-wolf brought forth a young one, and invited the fox to be godfather. \"After all, he is a near relative of ours,\" said she, \"he has a good understanding, and much talent; he can instruct my little son, and help him forward in the world.\" The fox, too, appeared quite honest, and said, \"Worthy Mrs. Gossip, I thank you for the honour which you are doing me; I will, however, conduct myself in such a way that you shall be repaid for it.\" He enjoyed himself at the feast, and made merry; afterwards he said, \"Dear Mrs. Gossip, it is our duty to take care of the child, it must have good food that it may be strong. I know a sheep-fold from which we might fetch a nice morsel.\" The wolf was pleased with the ditty, and she went out with the fox to the farm-yard. He pointed out the fold from afar, and said, \"You will be able to creep in there without being seen, and in the meantime I will look about on the other side to see if I can pick up a chicken.\" He, however, did not go there, but sat down at the entrance to the forest, stretched his legs and rested. The she-wolf crept into the stable. A dog was lying there, and it made such a noise that the peasants came running out, caught Gossip Wolf, and poured a strong burning mixture, which had been prepared for washing, over her skin. At last she escaped, and dragged herself outside. There lay the fox, who pretended to be full of complaints, and said, \"Ah, dear Mistress Gossip, how ill I have fared, the peasants have fallen on me, and have broken every limb I have; if you do not want me to lie where I am and perish, you must carry me away.\" The she-wolf herself was only able to go away slowly, but she was in such concern about the fox that she took him on her back, and slowly carried him perfectly safe and sound to her house. Then the fox cried to her, \"Farewell, dear Mistress Gossip, may the roasting you have had do you good,\" laughed heartily at her, and bounded off.</string>
    <string name="story349text">A rich farmer was one day standing in his yard inspecting his fields and gardens. The corn was growing up vigorously and the fruit-trees were heavily laden with fruit. The grain of the year before still lay in such immense heaps on the floors that the rafters could hardly bear it. Then he went into the stable, where were well-fed oxen, fat cows, and horses bright as looking-glass. At length he went back into his sitting-room, and cast a glance at the iron chest in which his money lay.\nWhilst he was thus standing surveying his riches, all at once there was a loud knock close by him. The knock was not at the door of his room, but at the door of his heart. It opened, and he heard a voice which said to him, \"Hast thou done good to thy family with it? Hast thou considered the necessities of the poor? Hast thou shared thy bread with the hungry? Hast thou been contented with what thou hast, or didst thou always desire to have more?\" The heart was not slow in answering, \"I have been hard and pitiless, and have never shown any kindness to my own family. If a beggar came, I turned away my eyes from him. I have not troubled myself about God, but have thought only of increasing my wealth. If everything which the sky covers had been mine own, I should still not have had enough.\"\n\nWhen he was aware of this answer he was greatly alarmed, his knees began to tremble, and he was forced to sit down.\n\nThen there was another knock, but the knock was at the door of his room. It was his neighbour, a poor man who had a number of children whom he could no longer satisfy with food. \"I know,\" thought the poor man, \"that my neighbour is rich, but he is as hard as he is rich. I don\'t believe he will help me, but my children are crying for bread, so I will venture it.\" He said to the rich man, \"You do not readily give away anything that is yours, but I stand here like one who feels the water rising above his head. My children are starving, lend me four measures* of corn.\" The rich man looked at him long, and then the first sunbeam of mercy began to melt away a drop of the ice of greediness. \"I will not lend thee four measures,\" he answered, \"but I will make thee a present of eight, but thou must fulfil one condition.\" - \"What am I to do?\" said the poor man. \"When I am dead, thou shalt watch for three nights by my grave.\" The peasant was disturbed in his mind at this request, but in the need in which he was, he would have consented to anything; he accepted, therefore, and carried the corn home with him.\n\nIt seemed as if the rich man had foreseen what was about to happen, for when three days were gone by, he suddenly dropped down dead. No one knew exactly how it came to pass, but no one grieved for him. When he was buried, the poor man remembered his promise; he would willingly have been released from it, but he thought, \"After all, he acted kindly by me. I have fed my hungry children with his corn, and even if that were not the case, where I have once given my promise I must keep it.\" At nightfall he went into the churchyard, and seated himself on the grave-mound. Everything was quiet, only the moon appeared above the grave, and frequently an owl flew past and uttered her melancholy cry. When the sun rose, the poor man betook himself in safety to his home, and in the same manner the second night passed quietly by. On the evening of the third day he felt a strange uneasiness, it seemed to him that something was about to happen. When he went out he saw, by the churchyard-wall, a man whom he had never seen before. He was no longer young, had scars on his face, and his eyes looked sharply and eagerly around. He was entirely covered with an old cloak, and nothing was visible but his great riding-boots. \"What are you looking for here?\" the peasant asked. \"Are you not afraid of the lonely churchyard?\"\n\n\"I am looking for nothing,\" he answered, \"and I am afraid of nothing! I am like the youngster who went forth to learn how to shiver, and had his labour for his pains, but got the King\'s daughter to wife and great wealth with her, only I have remained poor. I am nothing but a paid-off soldier, and I mean to pass the night here, because I have no other shelter.\" - \"If you are without fear,\" said the peasant, \"stay with me, and help me to watch that grave there.\"\n\n\"To keep watch is a soldier\'s business,\" he replied, \"whatever we fall in with here, whether it be good or bad, we will share it between us.\" The peasant agreed to this, and they seated themselves on the grave together.\n\nAll was quiet until midnight, when suddenly a shrill whistling was heard in the air, and the two watchers perceived the Evil One standing bodily before them. \"Be off, you ragamuffins!\" cried he to them, \"the man who lies in that grave belongs to me; I want to take him, and if you don\'t go away I will wring your necks!\" - \"Sir with the red feather,\"* said the soldier, \"you are not my captain, I have no need to obey you, and I have not yet learned how to fear. Go away, we shall stay sitting here.\"\n\nThe Devil thought to himself, \"Money is the best thing with which to get hold of these two vagabonds.\" So he began to play a softer tune, and asked quite kindly, if they would not accept a bag of money, and go home with it? \"That is worth listening to,\" answered the soldier, \"but one bag of gold won\'t serve us, if you will give as much as will go into one of my boots, we will quit the field for you and go away.\"\n\n\"I have not so much as that about me,\" said the Devil, \"but I will fetch it. In the neighbouring town lives a money-changer who is a good friend of mine, and will readily advance it to me.\" When the Devil had vanished the soldier took his left boot off, and said, \"We will soon pull the charcoal-burner\'s nose for him, just give me your knife, comrade.\" He cut the sole off the boot, and put it in the high grass near the grave on the edge of a hole that was half over-grown. \"That will do,\" said he; \"now the chimney-sweep may come.\n\nThey both sat down and waited, and it was not long before the Devil returned with a small bag of gold in his hand. \"Just pour it in,\" said the soldier, raising up the boot a little, \"but that won\'t be enough.\"\n\nThe Black One shook out all that was in the bag; the gold fell through, and the boot remained empty. \"Stupid Devil,\" cried the soldier, \"it won\'t do! Didn\'t I say so at once? Go back again, and bring more.\" The Devil shook his head, went, and in an hour\'s time came with a much larger bag under his arm. \"Now pour it in,\" cried the soldier, \"but I doubt the boot won\'t be full.\" The gold clinked as it fell, but the boot remained empty. The Devil looked in himself with his burning eyes, and convinced himself of the truth. \"You have shamefully big calves to your legs!\" cried he, and made a wry face. \"Did you think,\" replied the soldier, \"that I had a cloven foot like you? Since when have you been so stingy? See that you get more gold together, or our bargain will come to nothing!\" The Wicked One went off again. This time he stayed away longer, and when at length he appeared he was panting under the weight of a sack which lay on his shoulders. He emptied it into the boot, which was just as far from being filled as before. He became furious, and was just going to tear the boot out of the soldier\'s hands, but at that moment the first ray of the rising sun broke forth from the sky, and the Evil Spirit fled away with loud shrieks. The poor soul was saved.\n\nThe peasant wished to divide the gold, but the soldier said, \"Give what falls to my lot to the poor, I will come with thee to thy cottage, and together we will live in rest and peace on what remains, as long as God is pleased to permit.\"</string>
    <string name="story350text">There were once a cock and a hen who wanted to take a journey together. So the cock built a beautiful carriage, which had four red wheels, and harnessed four mice to it. The hen seated herself in it with the cock, and they drove away together. Not long afterwards they met a cat who said, \"Where are you going?\" The cock replied, \"We are going to the house of Herr Korbes.\" - \"Take me with you,\" said the cat. The cock answered, \"Most willingly, get up behind, lest you fall off in front. Take great care not to dirty my little red wheels. And you little wheels, roll on, and you little mice pipe out, as we go forth on our way to the house of Herr Korbes.\"\nAfter this came a millstone, then an egg, then a duck, then a pin, and at last a needle, who all seated themselves in the carriage, and drove with them. When, however, they reached the house of Herr Korbes, Herr Korbes was not there. The mice drew the carriage into the barn, the hen flew with the cock upon a perch. The cat sat down by the hearth, the duck on the well-pole. The egg rolled itself into a towel, the pin stuck itself into the chair-cushion, the needle jumped on to the bed in the middle of the pillow, and the millstone laid itself over the door. Then Herr Korbes came home, went to the hearth, and was about to light the fire, when the cat threw a quantity of ashes in his face. He ran into the kitchen in a great hurry to wash it off, and the duck splashed some water in his face. He wanted to dry it with the towel, but the egg rolled up against him, broke, and glued up his eyes. He wanted to rest, and sat down in the chair, and then the pin pricked him. He fell in a passion, and threw himself on his bed, but as soon as he laid his head on the pillow, the needle pricked him, so that he screamed aloud, and was just going to run out into the wide world in his rage, but when he came to the house-door, the millstone leapt down and struck him dead. Herr Korbes must have been a very wicked man!</string>
    <string name="story351text">I\n\nIn a city named Franecker, located in West Friesland, some young boys and girls between the ages of five and six happened to be playing with one another. They chose one boy to play a butcher, another boy to play was to be a cook, and a third boy was to be a pig. Then they chose one girl to be a cook and another girl her assistant. The assistant was to catch the blood of the pig in a little bowl so they could make sausages. As agreed, the butcher now fell upon the little boy playing the pig, threw him to the ground, and slit his throat open with a knife, while the assistant cook caught the blood in her little bowl. A councilman was walking nearby and saw this wretched act. He immediately took the butcher with him and led him into the house of the mayor, who instantly summoned the entire council. They deliberated about this incident and did not know what they should do to the boy, for they realized it had all been part of a children\'s game. One of the councilmen, an old wise man, advised the chief judge to take a beautiful red apple in one hand and a Rhenish gulden in the other. Then he was to call the boy and stretch out his hands to him. If the boy took the apple, he was to be set free. If he took the gulden, he was to be killed. The judge took the wise man\'s advice, and the boy grabbed the apple with a laugh. Thus he was set free without any punishment.\n\nII\n\nThere once was a father who slaughtered a pig, and his children saw that. In the afternoon, when they began playing, one child said to the other, \"you be the little pig, and I\'ll be the butcher.\" He then took a shiny knife and slit his little brother\'s throat. Their mother was upstairs in a room bathing another child, and when she heard the cries of her son, she immediately ran downstairs. Upon seeing what had happened, she took the knife out of her son\'s throat and was so enraged that she stabbed the heart of the other boy, who had been playing the butcher. Then she quickly ran back to the room to tend to her child in the bathtub, but while she was gone, he had drowned in the tub. Now the woman became so frightened and desperate that she did not allow the neighbors to comfort her and finally hung herself. When her husband came back from the fields and saw everything, he became so despondent that he died soon after.</string>
    <string name="story352text">A poor wood-cutter lived with his wife and three daughters in a little hut on the edge of a lonely forest. One morning as he was about to go to his work, he said to his wife, \"Let my dinner be brought into the forest to me by my eldest daughter, or I shall never get my work done, and in order that she may not miss her way,\" he added, \"I will take a bag of millet with me and strew the seeds on the path.\" When, therefore, the sun was just above the center of the forest, the girl set out on her way with a bowl of soup, but the field-sparrows, and wood-sparrows, larks and finches, blackbirds and siskins had picked up the millet long before, and the girl could not find the track. Then trusting to chance, she went on and on, until the sun sank and night began to fall. The trees rustled in the darkness, the owls hooted, and she began to be afraid. Then in the distance she perceived a light which glimmered between the trees. \"There ought to be some people living there, who can take me in for the night,\" thought she, and went up to the light. It was not long before she came to a house the windows of which were all lighted up. She knocked, and a rough voice from inside cried, \"Come in.\" The girl stepped into the dark entrance, and knocked at the door of the room. \"Just come in,\" cried the voice, and when she opened the door, an old gray-haired man was sitting at the table, supporting his face with both hands, and his white beard fell down over the table almost as far as the ground. By the stove lay three animals, a hen, a cock, and a brindled cow. The girl told her story to the old man, and begged for shelter for the night. The man said,\n\"Pretty little hen,\nPretty little cock,\nAnd pretty brindled cow,\nWhat say ye to that?\"\n\"Duks,\" answered the animals, and that must have meant, \"We are willing,\" for the old man said, \"Here you shall have shelter and food, go to the fire, and cook us our supper.\" The girl found in the kitchen abundance of everything, and cooked a good supper, but had no thought of the animals. She carried the full dishes to the table, seated herself by the gray-haired man, ate and satisfied her hunger. When she had had enough, she said, \"But now I am tired, where is there a bed in which I can lie down, and sleep?\" The animals replied,\n\"Thou hast eaten with him,\nThou hast drunk with him,\nThou hast had no thought for us,\nSo find out for thyself where thou canst pass the night.\"\nThen said the old man, \"Just go upstairs, and thou wilt find a room with two beds, shake them up, and put white linen on them, and then I, too, will come and lie down to sleep.\" The girl went up, and when she had shaken the beds and put clean sheets on, she lay down in one of them without waiting any longer for the old man. After some time, however, the gray-haired man came, took his candle, looked at the girl and shook his head. When he saw that she had fallen into a sound sleep, he opened a trap-door, and let her down into the cellar.\nLate at night the wood-cutter came home, and reproached his wife for leaving him to hunger all day. \"It is not my fault,\" she replied, \"the girl went out with your dinner, and must have lost herself, but she is sure to come back to-morrow.\" The wood-cutter, however, arose before dawn to go into the forest, and requested that the second daughter should take him his dinner that day. \"I will take a bag with lentils,\" said he; \"the seeds are larger than millet, the girl will see them better, and can\'t lose her way.\" At dinner-time, therefore, the girl took out the food, but the lentils had disappeared. The birds of the forest had picked them up as they had done the day before, and had left none. The girl wandered about in the forest until night, and then she too reached the house of the old man, was told to go in, and begged for food and a bed. The man with the white beard again asked the animals,\n\n\n\"Pretty little hen,\nPretty little cock,\nAnd pretty brindled cow,\nWhat say ye to that?\"\nThe animals again replied \"Duks,\" and everything happened just as it had happened the day before. The girl cooked a good meal, ate and drank with the old man, and did not concern herself about the animals, and when she inquired about her bed they answered,\n\n\"Thou hast eaten with him, Thou hast drunk with him,\nThou hast had no thought for us,\nTo find out for thyself where thou canst pass the night.\"\nWhen she was asleep the old man came, looked at her, shook his head, and let her down into the cellar.\nOn the third morning the wood-cutter said to his wife, \"Send our youngest child out with my dinner to-day, she has always been good and obedient, and will stay in the right path, and not run about after every wild humble-bee, as her sisters did.\" The mother did not want to do it, and said, \"Am I to lose my dearest child, as well?\"\n\n\"Have no fear,\' he replied, \"the girl will not go astray; she is too prudent and sensible; besides I will take some peas with me, and strew them about. They are still larger than lentils, and will show her the way.\" But when the girl went out with her basket on her arm, the wood-pigeons had already got all the peas in their crops, and she did not know which way she was to turn. She was full of sorrow and never ceased to think how hungry her father would be, and how her good mother would grieve, if she did not go home. At length when it grew dark, she saw the light and came to the house in the forest. She begged quite prettily to be allowed to spend the night there, and the man with the white beard once more asked his animals,\n\n\"Pretty little hen,\nPretty little cock,\nAnd beautiful brindled cow,\nWhat say ye to that?\"\n\"Duks,\" said they. Then the girl went to the stove where the animals were lying, and petted the cock and hen, and stroked their smooth feathers with her hand, and caressed the brindled cow between her horns, and when, in obedience to the old man\'s orders, she had made ready some good soup, and the bowl was placed upon the table, she said, \"Am I to eat as much as I want, and the good animals to have nothing? Outside is food in plenty, I will look after them first.\" So she went and brought some barley and stewed it for the cock and hen, and a whole armful of sweet- smelling hay for the cow. \"I hope you will like it, dear animals,\" said she, \"and you shall have a refreshing draught in case you are thirsty.\" Then she fetched in a bucketful of water, and the cock and hen jumped on to the edge of it and dipped their beaks in, and then held up their heads as the birds do when they drink, and the brindled cow also took a hearty draught. When the animals were fed, the girl seated herself at the table by the old man, and ate what he had left. It was not long before the cock and the hen began to thrust their heads beneath their wings, and the eyes of the cow likewise began to blink. Then said the girl, \"Ought we not to go to bed?\"\n\"Pretty little hen,\nPretty little cock,\nAnd pretty brindled cow,\nWhat say ye to that?\"\nThe animals answered \"Duks,\"\n\"Thou hast eaten with us,\nThou hast drunk with us,\nThou hast had kind thought for all of us,\nWe wish thee good-night.\"\nThen the maiden went upstairs, shook the feather-beds, and laid clean sheets on them, and when she had done it the old man came and lay down on one of the beds, and his white beard reached down to his feet. The girl lay down on the other, said her prayers, and fell asleep.\nShe slept quietly till midnight, and then there was such a noise in the house that she awoke. There was a sound of cracking and splitting in every corner, and the doors sprang open, and beat against the walls. The beams groaned as if they were being torn out of their joints, it seemed as if the staircase were falling down, and at length there was a crash as if the entire roof had fallen in. As, however, all grew quiet once more, and the girl was not hurt, she stayed quietly lying where she was, and fell asleep again. But when she woke up in the morning with the brilliancy of the sunshine, what did her eyes behold? She was lying in a vast hall, and everything around her shone with royal splendor; on the walls, golden flowers grew up on a ground of green silk, the bed was of ivory, and the canopy of red velvet, and on a chair close by, was a pair of shoes embroidered with pearls. The girl believed that she was in a dream, but three richly clad attendants came in, and asked what orders she would like to give? \"If you will go,\" she replied, \"I will get up at once and make ready some soup for the old man, and then I will feed the pretty little hen, and the cock, and the beautiful brindled cow.\" She thought the old man was up already, and looked round at his bed; he, however, was not lying in it, but a stranger. And while she was looking at him, and becoming aware that he was young and handsome, he awoke, sat up in bed, and said, \"I am a King\'s son, and was bewitched by a wicked witch, and made to live in this forest, as an old gray-haired man; no one was allowed to be with me but my three attendants in the form of a cock, a hen, and a brindled cow. The spell was not to be broken until a girl came to us whose heart was so good that she showed herself full of love, not only towards mankind, but towards animals - and that thou hast done, and by thee at midnight we were set free, and the old hut in the forest was changed back again into my royal palace.\" And when they had arisen, the King\'s son ordered the three attendants to set out and fetch the father and mother of the girl to the marriage feast. \"But where are my two sisters?\" inquired the maiden. \"I have locked them in the cellar, and to-morrow they shall be led into the forest, and shall live as servants to a charcoal-burner, until they have grown kinder, and do not leave poor animals to suffer hunger.\"</string>
    <string name="story353text">There was once on a time a King who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a huntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. \"Perhaps some accident has befallen him,\" said the King, and the next day he sent out two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away. Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said, \"Scour the whole forest through, and do not give up until ye have found all three.\" But of these also, none came home again, and of the pack of hounds which they had taken with them, none were seen more. From that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest, and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen of it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for many years, when a strange huntsman announced himself to the King as seeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest. The King, however, would not give his consent, and said, \"It is not safe in there; I fear it would fare with thee no better than with the others, and thou wouldst never come out again.\" The huntsman replied, \"Lord, I will venture it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.\"\nThe huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of the water, seized it, and drew it under, When the huntsman saw that, he went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the water. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There was great astonishment over the wild man; the King, however, had him put in an iron cage in his court-yard, and forbade the door to be opened on pain of death, and the Queen herself was to take the key into her keeping. And from this time forth every one could again go into the forest with safety.\n\nThe King had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the court-yard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage. The boy ran thither and said, \"Give me my ball out.\" - \"Not till thou hast opened the door for me,\" answered the man. \"No,\" said the boy, \"I will not do that; the King has forbidden it,\" and ran away. The next day he again went and asked for his ball; the wild man said, \"Open my door,\" but the boy would not. On the third day the King had ridden out hunting, and the boy went once more and said, \"I cannot open the door even if I wished, for I have not the key.\" Then the wild man said, \"It lies under thy mother\'s pillow, thou canst get it there.\" The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away. The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him, \"Oh, wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!\" The wild man turned back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest. When the King came home, he observed the empty cage, and asked the Queen how that had happened? She knew nothing about it, and sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one answered. The King sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but they did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court.\n\nWhen the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy down from his shoulder, and said to him, \"Thou wilt never see thy father and mother again, but I will keep thee with me, for thou hast set me free, and I have compassion on thee. If thou dost all I bid thee, thou shalt fare well. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the world.\" He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the next morning the man took him to a well, and said, \"Behold, the gold well is as bright and clear as crystal, thou shalt sit beside it, and take care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will come every evening to see if thou hast obeyed my order.\" The boy placed himself by the margin of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a golden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in. As he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he involuntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again, but saw that it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold off again, all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron John came back, looked at the boy, and said, \"What has happened to the well?\" - \"Nothing, nothing,\" he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it. But he said, \"Thou hast dipped thy finger into the water, this time it may pass, but take care thou dost not again let anything go in.\" By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and watching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head, and then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly out, but it was already quite gilded. Iron John came, and already knew what had happened. \"Thou hast let a hair fall into the well,\" said he. \"I will allow thee to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the third time then the well is polluted, and thou canst no longer remain with me.\"\n\nOn the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger, however much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of his head was already golden and shone like the sun. You may imagine how terrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it round his head, in order that the man might not see it. When he came he already knew everything, and said, \"Take the handkerchief off.\" Then the golden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might, it was of no use. \"Thou hast not stood the trial, and canst stay here no longer. Go forth into the world, there thou wilt learn what poverty is. But as thou hast not a bad heart, and as I mean well by thee, there is one thing I will grant thee; if thou fallest into any difficulty, come to the forest and cry, \"Iron John,\" and then I will come and help thee. My power is great, greater than thou thinkest, and I have gold and silver in abundance.\"\n\nThen the King\'s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he looked for work, but could find none, and he had learnt nothing by which he could help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they would take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use they could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At length the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood and water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he kept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under the King\'s notice, and he said, \"When thou comest to the royal table thou must take thy hat off.\" He answered, \"Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad sore place on my head.\" Then the King had the cook called before him and scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his service; and that he was to turn him off at once. The cook, however, had pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener\'s boy.\n\nAnd now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear the wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in the garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air might cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so that the rays fell into the bed-room of the King\'s daughter, and up she sprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to him, \"Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.\" He put his cap on with all haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he was ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said, \"How canst thou take the King\'s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go quickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.\" - \"Oh, no,\" replied the boy, \"the wild ones have more scent, and will please her better.\" When he got into the room, the King\'s daughter said, \"Take thy cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.\" He again said, \"I may not, I have a sore head.\" She, however, caught at his cap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his shoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she held him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he departed, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the gardener, and said, \"I present them to thy children, they can play with them.\" The following day the King\'s daughter again called to him that he was to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and when he went in with it, she instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him, but he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of ducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for playthings for his children. On the third day things went just the same; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her money.\n\nNot long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The King gathered together his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty army. Then said the gardener\'s boy, \"I am grown up, and will go to the wars also, only give me a horse.\" The others laughed, and said, \"Seek one for thyself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the stable for thee.\" When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and got the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jig, hobblety jig; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark forest. When he came to the outskirts, he called \"Iron John,\" three times so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man appeared immediately, and said, \"What dost thou desire?\" - \"I want a strong steed, for I am going to the wars.\" - \"That thou shalt have, and still more than thou askest for.\" Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of soldiers entirely equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the soldiers. When he got near the battle-field a great part of the King\'s men had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give way. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like a hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They began to fly, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there was not a single man left. Instead, however, of returning to the King, he conducted his troop by bye-ways back to the forest, and called forth Iron John. \"What dost thou desire?\" asked the wild man. \"Take back thy horse and thy troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.\" All that he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When the King returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and wished him joy of his victory. \"I am not the one who carried away the victory,\" said he, \"but a stranger knight who came to my assistance with his soldiers.\" The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was, but the King did not know, and said, \"He followed the enemy, and I did not see him again.\" She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but he smiled, and said, \"He has just come home on his three-legged horse, and the others have been mocking him, and crying, \"Here comes our hobblety jig back again!\" They asked, too, \"Under what hedge hast thou been lying sleeping all the time?\" He, however, said, \"I did the best of all, and it would have gone badly without me.\" And then he was still more ridiculed.\"\n\nThe King said to his daughter, \"I will proclaim a great feast that shall last for three days, and thou shalt throw a golden apple. Perhaps the unknown will come to it.\" When the feast was announced, the youth went out to the forest, and called Iron John. \"What dost thou desire?\" asked he. \"That I may catch the King\'s daughter\'s golden apple.\" - \"It is as safe as if thou hadst it already,\" said Iron John. \"Thou shalt likewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse.\" When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took his place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one. The King\'s daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none of them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away.\n\nOn the second day Iron John equipped him as a white knight, and gave him a white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The King grew angry, and said, \"That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell his name.\" He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple, should go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come back willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him.\n\nOn the third day, he received from Iron John a suit of black armour and a black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off with it, the King\'s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near him that he wounded the youth\'s leg with the point of his sword. The youth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently that the helmet fell from the youth\'s head, and they could see that he had golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the King.\n\nThe following day the King\'s daughter asked the gardener about his boy. \"He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the festival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise shown my children three golden apples which he has won.\"\n\nThe King had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had his little cap on his head. But the King\'s daughter went up to him and took it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and he was so handsome that all were amazed. \"Art thou the knight who came every day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught the three golden apples?\" asked the King. \"Yes,\" answered he, \"and here the apples are,\" and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them to the King. \"If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which your people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight who helped you to your victory over your enemies.\" - \"If thou canst perform such deeds as that, thou art no gardener\'s boy; tell me, who is thy father?\" - \"My father is a mighty King, and gold have I in plenty as great as I require.\" - \"I well see,\" said the King, \"that I owe thanks to thee; can I do anything to please thee?\" - \"Yes,\" answered he, \"that indeed you can. Give me your daughter to wife.\" The maiden laughed, and said, \"He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his golden hair that he was no gardener\'s boy,\" and then she went and kissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great delight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again. And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately King came in with a great retinue. He went up to the youth, embraced him and said, \"I am Iron John, and was by enchantment a wild man, but thou hast set me free; all the treasures which I possess, shall be thy property.\"</string>
    <string name="story354text">In the days when wishing was still of some use, a King\'s son was bewitched by an old witch, and shut up in an iron stove in a forest. There he passed many years, and no one could deliver him. Then a King\'s daughter came into the forest, who had lost herself, and could not find her father\'s kingdom again. After she had wandered about for nine days, she at length came to the iron stove. Then a voice came forth from it, and asked her, \"Whence comest thou, and whither goest, thou?\" She answered, \"I have lost my father\'s kingdom, and cannot get home again.\" Then a voice inside the iron stove said, \"I will help thee to get home again, and that indeed most swiftly, if thou wilt promise to do what I desire of thee. I am the son of a far greater King than thy father, and I will marry thee.\"\nThen was she afraid, and thought, \"Good heavens! What can I do with an iron stove?\" But as she much wished to get home to her father, she promised to do as he desired. But he said, \"Thou shalt return here, and bring a knife with thee, and scrape a hole in the iron.\" Then he gave her a companion who walked near her, but did not speak, but in two hours he took her home; there was great joy in the castle when the King\'s daughter came home, and the old King fell on her neck and kissed her. She, however, was sorely troubled, and said, \"Dear father, what I have suffered! I should never have got home again from the great wild forest, if I had not come to an iron stove, but I have been forced to give my word that I will go back to it, set it free, and marry it.\" Then the old King was so terrified that he all but fainted, for he had but this one daughter. They therefore resolved they would send, in her place, the miller\'s daughter, who was very beautiful. They took her there, gave her a knife, and said she was to scrape at the iron stove. So she scraped at it for four-and-twenty hours, but could not bring off the least morsel of it. When day dawned, a voice in the stove said, \"It seems to me it is day outside.\" Then she answered, \"It seems so to me too; I fancy I hear the noise of my father\'s mill.\"\n\n\"So thou art a miller\'s daughter! Then go thy way at once, and let the King\'s daughter come here.\" Then she went away at once, and told the old King that the man outside there, would have none of her he wanted the King\'s daughter. They, however, still had a swine-herd\'s daughter, who was even prettier than the miller\'s daughter, and they determined to give her a piece of gold to go to the iron stove instead of the King\'s daughter. So she was taken thither, and she also had to scrape for four-and-twenty hours. She, however, made nothing of it. When day broke, a voice inside the stove cried, \"It seems to me it is day outside!\" Then answered she, \"So it seems to me also; I fancy I hear my father\'s horn blowing.\"\n\n\"Then thou art a swine-herd\'s daughter! Go away at once, and tell the King\'s daughter to come, and tell her all must be done as promised, and if she does not come, everything in the kingdom shall be ruined and destroyed, and not one stone be left standing on another.\" When the King\'s daughter heard that she began to weep, but now there was nothing for it but to keep her promise. So she took leave of her father, put a knife in her pocket, and went forth to the iron stove in the forest. When she got there, she began to scrape, and the iron gave way, and when two hours were over, she had already scraped a small hole. Then she peeped in, and saw a youth so handsome, and so brilliant with gold and with precious jewels, that her very soul was delighted. Now, therefore, she went on scraping, and made the hole so large that he was able to get out. Then said he, \"Thou art mine, and I am thine; thou art my bride, and hast released me.\" He wanted to take her away with him to his kingdom, but she entreated him to let her go once again to her father, and the King\'s son allowed her to do so, but she was not to say more to her father than three words, and then she was to come back again. So she went home, but she spoke more than three words, and instantly the iron stove disappeared, and was taken far away over glass mountains and piercing swords; but the King\'s son was set free, and no longer shut up in it. After this she bade good-bye to her father, took some money with her, but not much, and went back to the great forest, and looked for the iron stove, but it was nowhere to be found. For nine days she sought it, and then her hunger grew so great that she did not know what to do, for she could no longer live. When it was evening, she seated herself in a small tree, and made up her mind to spend the night there, as she was afraid of wild beasts. When midnight drew near she saw in the distance a small light, and thought, \"Ah, there I should be saved!\" She got down from the tree, and went towards the light, but on the way she prayed. Then she came to a little old house, and much grass had grown all about it, and a small heap of wood lay in front of it. She thought, \"Ah, whither have I come,\" and peeped in through the window, but she saw nothing inside but toads, big and little, except a table well covered with wine and roast meat, and the plates and glasses were of silver. Then she took courage, and knocked at the door. The fat toad cried,\n\n\n\"Little green waiting-maid,\nWaiting-maid with the limping leg,\nLittle dog of the limping leg,\nHop hither and thither,\nAnd quickly see who is without:\"\nand a small toad came walking by and opened the door to her. When she entered, they all bade her welcome, and she was forced to sit down. They asked, \"Where hast thou come from, and whither art thou going?\" Then she related all that had befallen her, and how because she had transgressed the order which had been given her not to say more than three words, the stove, and the King\'s son also, had disappeared, and now she was about to seek him over hill and dale until she found him. Then the old fat one said,\n\n\"Little green waiting-maid,\nWaiting-maid with the limping leg,\nLittle dog of the limping leg,\nHop hither and thither,\nAnd bring me the great box.\"\nThen the little one went and brought the box. After this they gave her meat and drink, and took her to a well-made bed, which felt like silk and velvet, and she laid herself therein, in God\'s name, and slept. When morning came she arose, and the old toad gave her three needles out of the great box which she was to take with her; they would be needed by her, for she had to cross a high glass mountain, and go over three piercing swords and a great lake. If she did all this she would get her lover back again. Then she gave her three things, which she was to take the greatest care of, namely, three large needles, a plough-wheel, and three nuts. With these she travelled onwards, and when she came to the glass mountain which was so slippery, she stuck the three needles first behind her feet and then before them, and so got over it, and when she was over it, she hid them in a place which she marked carefully. After this she came to the three piercing swords, and then she seated herself on her plough-wheel, and rolled over them. At last she arrived in front of a great lake, and when she had crossed it, she came to a large and beautiful castle. She went and asked for a place; she was a poor girl, she said, and would like to be hired. She knew, however, that the King\'s son whom she had released from the iron stove in the great forest was in the castle. Then she was taken as a scullery-maid at low wages. But, already the King\'s son had another maiden by his side whom he wanted to marry, for he thought that she had long been dead.\nIn the evening, when she had washed up and was done, she felt in her pocket and found the three nuts which the old toad had given her. She cracked one with her teeth, and was going to eat the kernel when lo and behold there was a stately royal garment in it! But when the bride heard of this she came and asked for the dress, and wanted to buy it, and said, \"It is not a dress for a servant-girl.\" But she said no, she would not sell it, but if the bride would grant her one thing she should have it, and that was, leave to sleep one night in her bridegroom\'s chamber. The bride gave her permission because the dress was so pretty, and she had never had one like it. When it was evening she said to her bridegroom, \"That silly girl will sleep in thy room.\" - \"If thou art willing so am I,\" said he. She, however, gave him a glass of wine in which she had poured a sleeping-draught. So the bridegroom and the scullery-maid went to sleep in the room, and he slept so soundly that she could not waken him.\n\nShe wept the whole night and cried, \"I set thee free when thou wert in an iron stove in the wild forest, I sought thee, and walked over a glass mountain, and three sharp swords, and a great lake before I found thee, and yet thou wilt not hear me!\"\n\nThe servants sat by the chamber-door, and heard how she thus wept the whole night through, and in the morning they told it to their lord. And the next evening when she had washed up, she opened the second nut, and a far more beautiful dress was within it, and when the bride beheld it, she wished to buy that also. But the girl would not take money, and begged that she might once again sleep in the bridegroom\'s chamber. The bride, however, gave him a sleeping-drink, and he slept so soundly that he could hear nothing. But the scullery-maid wept the whole night long, and cried, \"I set thee free when thou wert in an iron stove in the wild forest, I sought thee, and walked over a glass mountain, and over three sharp swords and a great lake before I found thee, and yet thou wilt not hear me!\" The servants sat by the chamber-door and heard her weeping the whole night through, and in the morning informed their lord of it. And on the third evening, when she had washed up, she opened the third nut, and within it was a still more beautiful dress which was stiff with pure gold. When the bride saw that she wanted to have it, but the maiden only gave it up on condition that she might for the third time sleep in the bridegroom\'s apartment. The King\'s son was, however, on his guard, and threw the sleeping-draught away. Now, therefore, when she began to weep and to cry, \"Dearest love, I set thee free when thou wert in the iron stove in the terrible wild forest,\" the King\'s son leapt up and said, \"Thou art the true one, thou art mine, and I am thine.\" Thereupon, while it was still night, he got into a carriage with her, and they took away the false bride\'s clothes so that she could not get up. When they came to the great lake, they sailed across it, and when they reached the three sharp-cutting swords they seated themselves on the plough-wheel, and when they got to the glass mountain they thrust the three needles in it, and so at length they got to the little old house; but when they went inside that, it was a great castle, and the toads were all disenchanted, and were King\'s children, and full of happiness. Then the wedding was celebrated, and the King\'s son and the princess remained in the castle, which was much larger than the castles of their fathers. As, however, the old King grieved at being left alone, they fetched him away, and brought him to live with them, and they had two kingdoms, and lived in happy wedlock.\n\n\nA mouse did run,\nThis story is done.</string>
    <string name="story356text">There was once an old castle in the midst of a large and thick forest, and in it an old woman who was a witch dwelt all alone. In the day-time she changed herself into a cat or a screech-owl, but in the evening she took her proper shape again as a human being. She could lure wild beasts and birds to her, and then she killed and boiled and roasted them. If any one came within one hundred paces of the castle he was obliged to stand still, and could not stir from the place until she bade him be free. But whenever an innocent maiden came within this circle, she changed her into a bird, and shut her up in a wicker-work cage, and carried the cage into a room in the castle. She had about seven thousand cages of rare birds in the castle.\nNow, there was once a maiden who was called Jorinda, who was fairer than all other girls. She and a handsome youth named Joringel had promised to marry each other. They were still in the days of betrothal, and their greatest happiness was being together. One day in order that they might be able to talk together in quiet they went for a walk in the forest. \"Take care,\" said Joringel, \"that you do not go too near the castle.\"\n\nIt was a beautiful evening; the sun shone brightly between the trunks of the trees into the dark green of the forest, and the turtle-doves sang mournfully upon the young boughs of the birch-trees.\n\nJorinda wept now and then: she sat down in the sunshine and was sorrowful. Joringel was sorrowful too; they were as sad as if they were about to die. Then they looked around them, and were quite at a loss, for they did not know by which way they should go home. The sun was still half above the mountain and half set.\n\nJoringel looked through the bushes, and saw the old walls of the castle close at hand. He was horror-stricken and filled with deadly fear. Jorinda was singing,\n\n\"My little bird, with the necklace red,\nSings sorrow, sorrow, sorrow,\nHe sings that the dove must soon be dead,\nSings sorrow, sor — jug, jug, jug.\"\n\nJoringel looked for Jorinda. She was changed into a nightingale, and sang, \"jug, jug, jug.\" A screech-owl with glowing eyes flew three times round about her, and three times cried, \"to-whoo, to-whoo, to-whoo!\"\n\nJoringel could not move: he stood there like a stone, and could neither weep nor speak, nor move hand or foot.\n\nThe sun had now set. The owl flew into the thicket, and directly afterwards there came out of it a crooked old woman, yellow and lean, with large red eyes and a hooked nose, the point of which reached to her chin. She muttered to herself, caught the nightingale, and took it away in her hand.\n\nJoringel could neither speak nor move from the spot; the nightingale was gone. At last the woman came back, and said in a hollow voice, \"Greet thee, Zachiel. If the moon shines on the cage, Zachiel, let him loose at once.\" Then Joringel was freed. He fell on his knees before the woman and begged that she would give him back his Jorinda, but she said that he should never have her again, and went away. He called, he wept, he lamented, but all in vain,\"Ah, what is to become of me?\"\n\nJoringel went away, and at last came to a strange village; there he kept sheep for a long time. He often walked round and round the castle, but not too near to it. At last he dreamt one night that he found a blood-red flower, in the middle of which was a beautiful large pearl; that he picked the flower and went with it to the castle, and that everything he touched with the flower was freed from enchantment; he also dreamt that by means of it he recovered his Jorinda.\n\nIn the morning, when he awoke, he began to seek over hill and dale if he could find such a flower. He sought until the ninth day, and then, early in the morning, he found the blood-red flower. In the middle of it there was a large dew-drop, as big as the finest pearl.\n\nDay and night he journeyed with this flower to the castle. When he was within a hundred paces of it he was not held fast, but walked on to the door. Joringel was full of joy; he touched the door with the flower, and it sprang open. He walked in through the courtyard, and listened for the sound of the birds. At last he heard it. He went on and found the room from whence it came, and there the witch was feeding the birds in the seven thousand cages.\n\nWhen she saw Joringel she was angry, very angry, and scolded and spat poison and gall at him, but she could not come within two paces of him. He did not take any notice of her, but went and looked at the cages with the birds; but there were many hundred nightingales, how was he to find his Jorinda again?\n\nJust then he saw the old woman quietly take away a cage with a bird in it, and go towards the door.\n\nSwiftly he sprang towards her, touched the cage with the flower, and also the old woman. She could now no longer bewitch any one; and Jorinda was standing there, clasping him round the neck, and she was as beautiful as ever!</string>
    <string name="story357text">A King had a daughter who was beautiful beyond all measure, but so proud and haughty withal that no suitor was good enough for her. She sent away one after the other, and ridiculed them as well.\nOnce the King made a great feast and invited thereto, from far and near, all the young men likely to marry. They were all marshalled in a row according to their rank and standing; first came the kings, then the grand-dukes, then the princes, the earls, the barons, and the gentry. Then the King\'s daughter was led through the ranks, but to every one she had some objection to make; one was too fat, \"The wine-cask,\" she said. Another was too tall, \"Long and thin has little in.\" The third was too short, \"Short and thick is never quick.\" The fourth was too pale, \"As pale as death.\" The fifth too red, \"A fighting-cock.\" The sixth was not straight enough, \"A green log dried behind the stove.\"\n\nSo she had something to say against every one, but she made herself especially merry over a good king who stood quite high up in the row, and whose chin had grown a little crooked. \"Well,\" she cried and laughed, \"he has a chin like a thrush\'s beak!\" and from that time he got the name of King Thrushbeard.\n\nBut the old King, when he saw that his daughter did nothing but mock the people, and despised all the suitors who were gathered there, was very angry, and swore that she should have for her husband the very first beggar that came to his doors.\n\nA few days afterwards a fiddler came and sang beneath the windows, trying to earn a small alms. When the King heard him he said, \"Let him come up.\" So the fiddler came in, in his dirty, ragged clothes, and sang before the King and his daughter, and when he had ended he asked for a trifling gift. The King said, \"Your song has pleased me so well that I will give you my daughter there, to wife.\"\n\nThe King\'s daughter shuddered, but the King said, \"I have taken an oath to give you to the very first beggar-man, and I will keep it.\" All she could say was in vain; the priest was brought, and she had to let herself be wedded to the fiddler on the spot. When that was done the King said, \"Now it is not proper for you, a beggar-woman, to stay any longer in my palace, you may just go away with your husband.\"\n\nThe beggar-man led her out by the hand, and she was obliged to walk away on foot with him. When they came to a large forest she asked, \"To whom does that beautiful forest belong?\" - \"It belongs to King Thrushbeard; if you had taken him, it would have been yours.\" - \"Ah, unhappy girl that I am, if I had but taken King Thrushbeard!\"\n\nAfterwards they came to a meadow, and she asked again, \"To whom does this beautiful green meadow belong?\" - \"It belongs to King Thrushbeard; if you had taken him, it would have been yours.\" - \"Ah, unhappy girl that I am, if I had but taken King Thrushbeard!\"\n\nThen they came to a large town, and she asked again, \"To whom does this fine large town belong?\" - \"It belongs to King Thrushbeard; if you had taken him, it would have been yours.\" - \"Ah, unhappy girl that I am, if I had but taken King Thrushbeard!\"\n\n\"It does not please me,\" said the fiddler, \"to hear you always wishing for another husband; am I not good enough for you?\" At last they came to a very little hut, and she said, \"Oh goodness! what a small house; to whom does this miserable, mean hovel belong?\" The fiddler answered, \"That is my house and yours, where we shall live together.\"\n\nShe had to stoop in order to go in at the low door. \"Where are the servants?\" said the King\'s daughter. \"What servants?\" answered the beggar-man; \"you must yourself do what you wish to have done. Just make a fire at once, and set on water to cook my supper, I am quite tired.\" But the King\'s daughter knew nothing about lighting fires or cooking, and the beggar-man had to lend a hand himself to get anything fairly done. When they had finished their scanty meal they went to bed; but he forced her to get up quite early in the morning in order to look after the house.\n\nFor a few days they lived in this way as well as might be, and came to the end of all their provisions. Then the man said, \"Wife, we cannot go on any longer eating and drinking here and earning nothing. You weave baskets.\" He went out, cut some willows, and brought them home. Then she began to weave, but the tough willows wounded her delicate hands.\n\n\"I see that this will not do,\" said the man; \"you had better spin, perhaps you can do that better.\" She sat down and tried to spin, but the hard thread soon cut her soft fingers so that the blood ran down. \"See,\" said the man, \"you are fit for no sort of work; I have made a bad bargain with you. Now I will try to make a business with pots and earthenware; you must sit in the market-place and sell the ware.\" - \"Alas,\" thought she, \"if any of the people from my father\'s kingdom come to the market and see me sitting there, selling, how they will mock me?\" But it was of no use, she had to yield unless she chose to die of hunger.\n\nFor the first time she succeeded well, for the people were glad to buy the woman\'s wares because she was good-looking, and they paid her what she asked; many even gave her the money and left the pots with her as well. So they lived on what she had earned as long as it lasted, then the husband bought a lot of new crockery. With this she sat down at the corner of the market-place, and set it out round about her ready for sale. But suddenly there came a drunken hussar galloping along, and he rode right amongst the pots so that they were all broken into a thousand bits. She began to weep, and did now know what to do for fear. \"Alas! what will happen to me?\" cried she; \"what will my husband say to this?\"\n\nShe ran home and told him of the misfortune. \"Who would seat herself at a corner of the market-place with crockery?\" said the man; \"leave off crying, I see very well that you cannot do any ordinary work, so I have been to our King\'s palace and have asked whether they cannot find a place for a kitchen-maid, and they have promised me to take you; in that way you will get your food for nothing.\"\n\nThe King\'s daughter was now a kitchen-maid, and had to be at the cook\'s beck and call, and do the dirtiest work. In both her pockets she fastened a little jar, in which she took home her share of the leavings, and upon this they lived.\n\nIt happened that the wedding of the King\'s eldest son was to be celebrated, so the poor woman went up and placed herself by the door of the hall to look on. When all the candles were lit, and people, each more beautiful than the other, entered, and all was full of pomp and splendour, she thought of her lot with a sad heart, and cursed the pride and haughtiness which had humbled her and brought her to so great poverty.\n\nThe smell of the delicious dishes which were being taken in and out reached her, and now and then the servants threw her a few morsels of them: these she put in her jars to take home.\n\nAll at once the King\'s son entered, clothed in velvet and silk, with gold chains about his neck. And when he saw the beautiful woman standing by the door he seized her by the hand, and would have danced with her; but she refused and shrank with fear, for she saw that it was King Thrushbeard, her suitor whom she had driven away with scorn. Her struggles were of no avail, he drew her into the hall; but the string by which her pockets were hung broke, the pots fell down, the soup ran out, and the scraps were scattered all about. And when the people saw it, there arose general laughter and derision, and she was so ashamed that she would rather have been a thousand fathoms below the ground. She sprang to the door and would have run away, but on the stairs a man caught her and brought her back; and when she looked at him it was King Thrushbeard again. He said to her kindly, \"Do not be afraid, I and the fiddler who has been living with you in that wretched hovel are one. For love of you I disguised myself so; and I also was the hussar who rode through your crockery. This was all done to humble your proud spirit, and to punish you for the insolence with which you mocked me.\"\n\nThen she wept bitterly and said, \"I have done great wrong, and am not worthy to be your wife.\" But he said, \"Be comforted, the evil days are past; now we will celebrate our wedding.\" Then the maids-in-waiting came and put on her the most splendid clothing, and her father and his whole court came and wished her happiness in her marriage with King Thrushbeard, and the joy now began in earnest. I wish you and I had been there too.</string>
    <string name="story358text">There was a certain merchant who had two children, a boy and a girl; they were both young, and could not walk. And two richly-laden ships of his sailed forth to sea with all his property on board, and just as he was expecting to win much money by them, news came that they had gone to the bottom, and now instead of being a rich man he was a poor one, and had nothing left but one field outside the town. In order to drive his misfortune a little out of his thoughts, he went out to this field, and as he was walking forwards and backwards in it, a little black mannikin stood suddenly by his side, and asked why he was so sad, and what he was taking so much to heart. Then said the merchant, \"If thou couldst help me I would willingly tell thee.\" - \"Who knows?\" replied the black dwarf. \"Perhaps, I can help thee.\" Then the merchant told him that all he possessed had gone to the bottom of the sea, and that he had nothing left but this field. \"Do not trouble thyself,\" said the dwarf. \"If thou wilt promise to give me the first thing that rubs itself against thy leg when thou art at home again, and to bring it here to this place in twelve years\' time, thou shalt have as much money as thou wilt.\" The merchant thought, \"What can that be but my dog?\" and did not remember his little boy, so he said yes, gave the black man a written and sealed promise, and went home.\n\nWhen he reached home, his little boy was so delighted that he held by a bench, tottered up to him and seized him fast by the legs. The father was shocked, for he remembered his promise, and now knew what he had pledged himself to do; as however, he still found no money in his chest, he thought the dwarf had only been jesting. A month afterwards he went up to the garret, intending to gather together some old tin and to sell it, and saw a great heap of money lying. Then he was happy again, made purchases, became a greater merchant than before, and felt that this world was well-governed. In the meantime the boy grew tall, and at the same time sharp and clever. But the nearer the twelfth year approached the more anxious grew the merchant, so that his distress might be seen in his face. One day his son asked what ailed him, but the father would not say. The boy, however, persisted so long, that at last he told him that without being aware of what he was doing, he had promised him to a black dwarf, and had received much money for doing so. He said likewise that he had set his hand and seal to this, and that now when twelve years had gone by he would have to give him up. Then said the son, \"Oh, father, do not be uneasy, all will go well. The black man has no power over me.\" The son had himself blessed by the priest, and when the time came, father and son went together to the field, and the son made a circle and placed himself inside it with his father. Then came the black dwarf and said to the old man, \"Hast thou brought with thee that which thou hast promised me?\" He was silent, but the son asked, \"What dost thou want here?\" Then said the black dwarf, \"I have to speak with thy father, and not with thee.\" The son replied, \"Thou hast betrayed and misled my father, give back the writing.\" - \"No,\" said the black dwarf, \"I will not give up my rights.\" They spoke together for a long time after this, but at last they agreed that the son, as he did not belong to the enemy of mankind, nor yet to his father, should seat himself in a small boat, which should lie on water which was flowing away from them, and that the father should push it off with his own foot, and then the son should remain given up to the water. So he took leave of his father, placed himself in a little boat, and the father had to push it off with his own foot. The boat capsized so that the keel was uppermost, and the father believed his son was lost, and went home and mourned for him.\n\nThe boat, however, did not sink, but floated quietly away, and the boy sat safely inside it, and it floated thus for a long time, until at last it stopped by an unknown shore. Then he landed and saw a beautiful castle before him, and set out to go to it. But when he entered it, he found that it was bewitched. He went through every room, but all were empty until he reached the last, where a snake lay coiled in a ring. The snake, however, was an enchanted maiden, who rejoiced to see him, and said, \"Hast thou come, oh, my deliverer? I have already waited twelve years for thee; this kingdom is bewitched, and thou must set it free.\" - \"How can I do that?\" he inquired. \"To-night come twelve black men, covered with chains who will ask what thou art doing here; keep silent; give them no answer, and let them do what they will with thee; they will torment thee, beat thee, stab thee; let everything pass, only do not speak; at twelve o\'clock, they must go away again. On the second night twelve others will come; on the third, four-and-twenty, who will cut off thy head, but at twelve o\'clock their power will be over, and then if thou hast endured all, and hast not spoken the slightest word, I shall be released. I will come to thee, and will have, in a bottle, some of the water of life. I will rub thee with that, and then thou wilt come to life again, and be as healthy as before.\" Then said he, \"I will gladly set thee free.\" And everything happened just as she had said; the black men could not force a single word from him, and on the third night the snake became a beautiful princess, who came with the water of life and brought him back to life again. So she threw herself into his arms and kissed him, and there was joy and gladness in the whole castle. After this their marriage was celebrated, and he was King of the Golden Mountain.\n\nThey lived very happily together, and the Queen bore a fine boy. Eight years had already gone by, when the King bethought him of his father; his heart was moved, and he wished to visit him. The Queen, however, would not let him go away, and said, \"I know beforehand that it will cause my unhappiness;\" but he suffered her to have no rest until she consented. At their parting she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, \"Take this ring and put it on thy finger, and then thou wilt immediately be transported whithersoever thou wouldst be, only thou must promise me not to use it in wishing me away from this place and with thy father.\" That he promised her, put the ring on his finger, and wished himself at home, just outside the town where his father lived. Instantly he found himself there, and made for the town, but when he came to the gate, the sentries would not let him in, because he wore such strange and yet such rich and magnificent clothing. Then he went to a hill where a shepherd was watching his sheep, changed clothes with him, put on his old shepherd\'s-coat, and then entered the town without hindrance. When he came to his father, he made himself known to him, but he did not at all believe that the shepherd was his son, and said he certainly had had a son, but that he was dead long ago; however, as he saw he was a poor, needy shepherd, he would give him something to eat. Then the shepherd said to his parents, \"I am verily your son. Do you know of no mark on my body by which you could recognize me?\" - \"Yes,\" said his mother, \"our son had a raspberry mark under his right arm.\" He slipped back his shirt, and they saw the raspberry under his right arm, and no longer doubted that he was their son. Then he told them that he was King of the Golden Mountain, and a king\'s daughter was his wife, and that they had a fine son of seven years old. Then said the father, \"That is certainly not true; it is a fine kind of a king who goes about in a ragged shepherd\'s-coat.\" On this the son fell in a passion, and without thinking of his promise, turned his ring round, and wished both his wife and child with him. They were there in a second, but the Queen wept, and reproached him, and said that he had broken his word, and had brought misfortune upon her. He said, \"I have done it thoughtlessly, and not with evil intention,\" and tried to calm her, and she pretended to believe this; but she had mischief in her mind.\n\nThen he led her out of the town into the field, and showed her the stream where the little boat had been pushed off, and then he said, \"I am tired; sit down, I will sleep awhile on thy lap.\" And he laid his head on her lap, and fell asleep. When he was asleep, she first drew the ring from his finger, then she drew away the foot which was under him, leaving only the slipper behind her, and she took her child in her arms, and wished herself back in her own kingdom. When he awoke, there he lay quite deserted, and his wife and child were gone, and so was the ring from his finger, the slipper only was still there as a token. \"Home to thy parents thou canst not return,\" thought he, \"they would say that thou wast a wizard; thou must be off, and walk on until thou arrivest in thine own kingdom.\" So he went away and came at length to a hill by which three giants were standing, disputing with each other because they did not know how to divide their father\'s property. When they saw him passing by, they called to him and said little men had quick wits, and that he was to divide their inheritance for them. The inheritance, however, consisted of a sword, which had this prperty that if any one took it in his hand, and said, \"All heads off but mine,\" every head would lie on the ground; secondly, of a cloak which made any one who put it on invisible; thirdly, of a pair of boots which could transport the wearer to any place he wished in a moment. He said, \"Give me the three things that I may see if they are still in good condition.\" They gave him the cloak, and when he had put it on, he was invisible and changed into a fly. Then he resumed his own form and said, \"The cloak is a good one, now give me the sword.\" They said, \"No, we will not give thee that; if thou were to say, All heads off but mine,\' all our heads would be off, and thou alone wouldst be left with thine.\" Nevertheless they gave it to him with the condition that he was only to try it against a tree. This he did, and the sword cut in two the trunk of a tree as if it had been a blade of straw. Then he wanted to have the boots likewise, but they said, \"No, we will not give them; if thou hadst them on thy feet and wert to wish thyself at the top of the hill, we should be left down here with nothing.\" - \"Oh, no,\" said he, \"I will not do that.\" So they gave him the boots as well. And now when he had got all these things, he thought of nothing but his wife and his child, and said as though to himself, \"Oh, if I were but on the Golden Mountain,\" and at the same moment he vanished from the sight of the giants, and thus their inheritance was divided. When he was near his palace, he heard sounds of joy, and fiddles, and flutes, and the people told him that his wife was celebrating her wedding with another. Then he fell into a rage, and said, \"False woman, she betrayed and deserted me whilst I was asleep!\" So he put on his cloak, and unseen by all went into the palace. When he entered the dining-hall a great table was spread with delicious food, and the guests were eating and drinking, and laughing, and jesting. She sat on a royal seat in the midst of them in splendid apparel, with a crown on her head. He placed himself behind her, and no one saw him. When she put a piece of meat on a plate for herself, he took it away and ate it, and when she poured out a glass of wine for herself, he took it away and drank it. She was always helping herself to something, and yet she never got anything, for plate and glass disappeared immediately. Then dismayed and ashamed, she arose and went to her chamber and wept, but he followed her there. She said, \"Has the devil power over me, or did my deliverer never come?\" Then he struck her in the face, and said, \"Did thy deliverer never come? It is he who has thee in his power, thou traitor. Have I deserved this from thee?\" Then he made himself visible, went into the hall, and cried, \"The wedding is at an end, the true King has returned.\" The kings, princes, and councillors who were assembled there, ridiculed and mocked him, but he did not trouble to answer them, and said, \"Will you go away, or not?\" On this they tried to seize him and pressed upon him, but he drew his sword and said, \"All heads off but mine,\" and all the heads rolled on the ground, and he alone was master, and once more King of the Golden Mountain.\n</string>
    <string name="story359text">There was once a King\'s son, who was no longer content to stay at home in his father\'s house, and as he had no fear of anything, he thought, \"I will go forth into the wide world, there the time will not seem long to me, and I shall see wonders enough.\" So he took leave of his parents, and went forth, and on and on from morning till night, and whichever way his path led it was the same to him. It came to pass that he got to the house of a giant, and as he was so tired he sat down by the door and rested. And as he let his eyes roam here and there, he saw the giant\'s playthings lying in the yard. These were a couple of enormous balls, and nine-pins as tall as a man. After a while he had a fancy to set the nine-pins up and then rolled the balls at them, and screamed and cried out when the nine-pins fell, and had a merry time of it. The giant heard the noise, stretched his head out of the window, and saw a man who was not taller than other men, and yet played with his nine-pins. \"Little worm,\" cried he, \"why art thou playing with my balls? Who gave thee strength to do it?\" The King\'s son looked up, saw the giant, and said, \"Oh, thou blockhead, thou thinkest indeed that thou only hast strong arms, I can do everything I want to do.\" The giant came down and watched the bowling with great admiration, and said, \"Child of man, if thou art one of that kind, go and bring me an apple of the tree of life.\" - \"What dost thou want with it?\" said the King\'s son. \"I do not want the apple for myself,\" answered the giant, \"but I have a betrothed bride who wishes for it. I have travelled far about the world and cannot find the tree.\" - \"I will soon find it,\" said the King\'s son, \"and I do not know what is to prevent me from getting the apple down.\" The giant said, \"Thou really believest it to be so easy! The garden in which the tree stands is surrounded by an iron railing, and in front of the railing lie wild beasts, each close to the other, and they keep watch and let no man go in.\" - \"They will be sure to let me in,\" said the King\'s son. \"Yes, but even if thou dost get into the garden, and seest the apple hanging to the tree, it is still not thine; a ring hangs in front of it, through which any one who wants to reach the apple and break it off, must put his hand, and no one has yet had the luck to do it.\" - \"That luck will be mine,\" said the King\'s son.\nThen he took leave of the giant, and went forth over mountain and valley, and through plains and forests, until at length he came to the wondrous garden.\n\nThe beasts lay round about it, but they had put their heads down and were asleep. Moreover, they did not awake when he went up to them, so he stepped over them, climbed the fence, and got safely into the garden. There, in the very middle of it, stood the tree of life, and the red apples were shining upon the branches. He climbed up the trunk to the top, and as he was about to reach out for an apple, he saw a ring hanging before it; but he thrust his hand through that without any difficulty, and gathered the apple. The ring closed tightly on his arm, and all at once he felt a prodigious strength flowing through his veins. When he had come down again from the tree with the apple, he would not climb over the fence, but grasped the great gate, and had no need to shake it more than once before it sprang open with a loud crash. Then he went out, and the lion which had been lying down before, was awake and sprang after him, not in rage and fierceness, but following him humbly as its master.\n\nThe King\'s son took the giant the apple he had promised him, and said, \"Seest thou, I have brought it without difficulty.\" The giant was glad that his desire had been so soon satisfied, hastened to his bride, and gave her the apple for which she had wished. She was a beautiful and wise maiden, and as she did not see the ring on his arm, she said, \"I shall never believe that thou hast brought the apple, until I see the ring on thine arm.\" The giant said, \"I have nothing to do but go home and fetch it,\" and thought it would be easy to take away by force from the weak man, what he would not give of his own free will. He therefore demanded the ring from him, but the King\'s son refused it. \"Where the apple is, the ring must be also,\" said the giant; \"if thou wilt not give it of thine own accord, thou must fight with me for it.\"\n\nThey wrestled with each other for a long time, but the giant could not get the better of the King\'s son, who was strengthened by the magical power of the ring. Then the giant thought of a stratagem, and said, \"I have got warm with fighting, and so hast thou. We will bathe in the river, and cool ourselves before we begin again.\" The King\'s son, who knew nothing of falsehood, went with him to the water, and pulled off with his clothes the ring also from his arm, and sprang into the river. The giant instantly snatched the ring, and ran away with it, but the lion, which had observed the theft, pursued the giant, tore the ring out of his hand, and brought it back to its master. Then the giant placed himself behind an oak-tree, and while the King\'s son was busy putting on his clothes again, surprised him, and put both his eyes out.\n\nAnd now the unhappy King\'s son stood there, and was blind and knew not how to help himself. Then the giant came back to him, took him by the hand as if he were someone who wanted to guide him, and led him to the top of a high rock. There he left him standing, and thought, \"Just two steps more, and he will fall down and kill himself, and I can take the ring from him.\" But the faithful lion had not deserted its master; it held him fast by the clothes, and drew him gradually back again. When the giant came and wanted to rob the dead man, he saw that his cunning had been in vain. \"Is there no way, then, of destroying a weak child of man like that?\" said he angrily to himself, and seized the King\'s son and led him back again to the precipice by another way, but the lion which saw his evil design, helped its master out of danger here also. When they had got close to the edge, the giant let the blind man\'s hand drop, and was going to leave him behind alone, but the lion pushed the giant so that he was thrown down and fell, dashed to pieces, on the ground.\n\nThe faithful animal again drew its master back from the precipice, and guided him to a tree by which flowed a clear brook. The King\'s son sat down there, but the lion lay down, and sprinkled the water in his face with its paws. Scarcely had a couple of drops wetted the sockets of his eyes, than he was once more able to see something, and remarked a little bird flying quite close by, which wounded itself against the trunk of a tree. On this it went down to the water and bathed itself therein, and then it soared upwards and swept between the trees without touching them, as if it had recovered its sight again. Then the King\'s son recognized a sign from God and stooped down to the water, and washed and bathed his face in it. And when he arose he had his eyes once more, brighter and clearer than they had ever been.\n\nThe King\'s son thanked God for his great mercy, and travelled with his lion onwards through the world. And it came to pass that he arrived before a castle which was enchanted. In the gateway stood a maiden of beautiful form and fine face, but she was quite black. She spoke to him and said, \"Ah, if thou couldst but deliver me from the evil spell which is thrown over me.\" - \"What shall I do?\" said the King\'s son. The maiden answered, \"Thou must pass three nights in the great hall of this enchanted castle, but thou must let no fear enter thy heart. When they are doing their worst to torment thee, if thou bearest it without letting a sound escape thee, I shall be free. Thy life they dare not take.\" Then said the King\'s son, \"I have no fear; with God\'s help I will try it.\" So he went gaily into the castle, and when it grew dark he seated himself in the large hall and waited. Everything was quiet, however, till midnight, when all at once a great tumult began, and out of every hole and corner came little devils. They behaved as if they did not see him, seated themselves in the middle of the room, lighted a fire, and began to gamble. When one of them lost, he said, \"It is not right; some one is here who does not belong to us; it is his fault that I am losing.\" - \"Wait, you fellow behind the stove, I am coming,\" said another. The screaming became still louder, so that no one could have heard it without terror. The King\'s son stayed sitting quite quietly, and was not afraid; but at last the devils jumped up from the ground, and fell on him, and there were so many of them that he could not defend himself from them. They dragged him about on the floor, pinched him, pricked him, beat him, and tormented him, but no sound escaped from him. Towards morning they disappeared, and he was so exhausted that he could scarcely move his limbs, but when day dawned the black maiden came to him. She bore in her hand a little bottle wherein was the water of life wherewith she washed him, and he at once felt all pain depart and new strength flow through his veins. She said, \"Thou hast held out successfully for one night, but two more lie before thee.\" Then she went away again, and as she was going, he observed that her feet had become white. The next night the devils came and began their gambols anew. They fell on the King\'s son, and beat him much more severely than the night before, until his body was covered with wounds. But as he bore all quietly, they were forced to leave him, and when dawn appeared, the maiden came and healed him with the water of life. And when she went away, he saw with joy that she had already become white to the tips of her fingers. And now he had only one night more to go through, but it was the worst. The hob-goblins came again: \"Art thou there still?\" cried they, \"thou shalt be tormented till thy breath stops.\" They pricked him and beat him, and threw him here and there, and pulled him by the arms and legs as if they wanted to tear him to pieces, but he bore everything, and never uttered a cry. At last the devils vanished, but he lay fainting there, and did not stir, nor could he raise his eyes to look at the maiden who came in, and sprinkled and bathed him with the water of life. But suddenly he was freed from all pain, and felt fresh and healthy as if he had awakened from sleep, and when he opened his eyes he saw the maiden standing by him, snow-white, and fair as day. \"Rise,\" said she, \"and swing thy sword three times over the stairs, and then all will be delivered.\" And when he had done that, the whole castle was released from enchantment, and the maiden was a rich King\'s daughter. The servants came and said that the table was already set in the great hall, and dinner served up. Then they sat down and ate and drank together, and in the evening the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicings.</string>
    <string name="story360text">There were once three brothers who had fallen deeper and deeper into poverty, and at last their need was so great that they had to endure hunger, and had nothing to eat or drink. Then said they, \"We cannot go on thus, we had better go into the world and seek our fortune.\" They therefore set out, and had already walked over many a long road and many a blade of grass, but had not yet met with good luck. One day they arrived in a great forest, and in the midst of it was a hill, and when they came nearer they saw that the hill was all silver. Then spoke the eldest, \"Now I have found the good luck I wished for, and I desire nothing more.\" He took as much of the silver as he could possibly carry, and then turned back and went home again. But the two others said, \"We want something more from good luck than mere silver,\" and did not touch it, but went onwards. After they had walked for two days longer without stopping, they came to a hill which was all gold. The second brother stopped, took thought with himself, and was undecided. \"What shall I do?\" said he; \"shall I take for myself so much of this gold, that I have sufficient for all the rest of my life, or shall I go farther?\" At length he made a decision, and putting as much into his pockets as would go in, said farewell to his brother, and went home. But the third said, \"Silver and gold do not move me, I will not renounce my chance of fortune, perhaps something better still will be given me.\" He journeyed onwards, and when he had walked for three days, he got into a forest which was still larger than the one before, and never would come to an end, and as he found nothing to eat or to drink, he was all but exhausted. Then he climbed up a high tree to find out if up there he could see the end of the forest, but so far as his eye could pierce he saw nothing but the tops of trees. Then he began to descend the tree again, but hunger tormented him, and he thought to himself, \"If I could but eat my fill once more!\" When he got down he saw with astonishment a table beneath the tree richly spread with food, the steam of which rose up to meet him. \"This time,\" said he, \"my wish has been fulfilled at the right moment.\" And without inquiring who had brought the food, or who had cooked it, he approached the table, and ate with enjoyment until he had appeased his hunger. When he was done, he thought, \"It would after all be a pity if the pretty little table-cloth were to be spoilt in the forest here,\" and folded it up tidily and put it in his pocket. Then he went onwards, and in the evening, when hunger once more made itself felt, he wanted to make a trial of his little cloth, and spread it out and said, \"I wish thee to be covered with good cheer again,\" and scarcely had the wish crossed his lips than as many dishes with the most exquisite food on them stood on the table as there was room for. \"Now I perceive,\" said he, \"in what kitchen my cooking is done. Thou shalt be dearer to me than the mountains of silver and gold.\" For he saw plainly that it was a wishing-cloth. The cloth, however, was still not enough to enable him to sit down quietly at home; he preferred to wander about the world and pursue his fortune farther. One night he met, in a lonely wood, a dusty, black charcoal-burner, who was burning charcoal there, and had some potatoes by the fire, on which he was going to make a meal. \"Good evening, blackbird!\" said the youth. \"How dost thou get on in thy solitude?\" - \"One day is like another,\" replied the charcoal-burner, \"and every night potatoes! Hast thou a mind to have some, and wilt thou be my guest?\" - \"Many thanks,\" replied the traveler, \"I won\'t rob thee of thy supper; thou didst not reckon on a visitor, but if thou wilt put up with what I have, thou shalt have an invitation.\" - \"Who is to prepare it for thee?\" said the charcoal-burner. \"I see that thou hast nothing with thee, and there is no one within a two hours\' walk who could give thee anything.\" - \"And yet there shall be a meal,\" answered the youth, \"and better than any thou hast ever tasted.\" Thereupon he brought his cloth out of his knapsack, spread it on the ground, and said, \"Little cloth, cover thyself,\" and instantly boiled meat and baked meat stood there, and as hot as if it had just come out of the kitchen. The charcoal-burner stared, but did not require much pressing; he fell to, and thrust larger and larger mouthfuls into his black mouth. When they had eaten everything, the charcoal-burner smiled contentedly, and said, \"Hark thee, thy table-cloth has my approval; it would be a fine thing for me in this forest, where no one ever cooks me anything good. I will propose an exchange to thee; there in the corner hangs a soldier\'s knapsack, which is certainly old and shabby, but in it lie concealed wonderful powers; but, as I no longer use it, I will give it to thee for the table-cloth.\" - \"I must first know what these wonderful powers are,\" answered the youth. \"That will I tell thee,\" replied the charcoal-burner; \"every time thou tappest it with thy hand, a corporal comes with six men armed from head to foot, and they do whatsoever thou commandest them.\" - \"So far as I am concerned,\" said the youth, \"if nothing else can be done, we will exchange,\" and he gave the charcoal-burner the cloth, took the knapsack from the hook, put it on, and bade farewell. When he had walked a while, he wished to make a trial of the magical powers of his knapsack and tapped it. Immediately the seven warriors stepped up to him, and the corporal said, \"What does my lord and ruler wish for?\" - \"March with all speed to the charcoal-burner, and demand my wishing-cloth back.\" They faced to the left, and it was not long before they brought what he required, and had taken it from the charcoal-burner without asking many questions. The young man bade them retire, went onwards, and hoped fortune would shine yet more brightly on him. By sunset he came to another charcoal-burner, who was making his supper ready by the fire. \"If thou wilt eat some potatoes with salt, but with no dripping, come and sit down with me,\" said the sooty fellow. \"No, he replied, this time thou shalt be my guest,\" and he spread out his cloth, which was instantly covered with the most beautiful dishes. They ate and drank together, and enjoyed themselves heartily. After the meal was over, the charcoal-burner said, \"Up there on that shelf lies a little old worn-out hat which has strange properties: when any one puts it on, and turns it round on his head, the cannons go off as if twelve were fired all together, and they shoot down everything so that no one can withstand them. The hat is of no use to me, and I will willingly give it for thy table-cloth.\" - \"That suits me very well,\" he answered, took the hat, put it on, and left his table-cloth behind him. Hardly, however, had he walked away than he tapped on his knapsack, and his soldiers had to fetch the cloth back again. \"One thing comes on the top of another,\" thought he, \"and I feel as if my luck had not yet come to an end.\" Neither had his thoughts deceived him. After he had walked on for the whole of one day, he came to a third charcoal-burner, who like the previous ones, invited him to potatoes without dripping. But he let him also dine with him from his wishing-cloth, and the charcoal-burner liked it so well, that at last he offered him a horn for it, which had very different properties from those of the hat. When any one blew it all the walls and fortifications fell down, and all towns and villages became ruins. He certainly gave the charcoal-burner the cloth for it, but he afterwards sent his soldiers to demand it back again, so that at length he had the knapsack, hat and horn, all three. \"Now,\" said he, \"I am a made man, and it is time for me to go home and see how my brothers are getting on.\"\n\nWhen he reached home, his brothers had built themselves a handsome house with their silver and gold, and were living in clover. He went to see them, but as he came in a ragged coat, with his shabby hat on his head, and his old knapsack on his back, they would not acknowledge him as their brother. They mocked and said, \"Thou givest out that thou art our brother who despised silver and gold, and craved for something still better for himself. He will come in his carriage in full splendour like a mighty king, not like a beggar,\" and they drove him out of doors. Then he fell into a rage, and tapped his knapsack until a hundred and fifty men stood before him armed from head to foot. He commanded them to surround his brothers\' house, and two of them were to take hazel-sticks with them, and beat the two insolent men until they knew who he was. A violent disturbance arose, people ran together, and wanted to lend the two some help in their need, but against the soldiers they could do nothing. News of this at length came to the King, who was very angry, and ordered a captain to march out with his troop, and drive this disturber of the peace out of the town; but the man with the knapsack soon got a greater body of men together, who repulsed the captain and his men, so that they were forced to retire with bloody noses. The King said, \"This vagabond is not brought to order yet,\" and next day sent a still larger troop against him, but they could do even less. The youth set still more men against them, and in order to be done the sooner, he turned his hat twice round on his head, and heavy guns began to play, and the king\'s men were beaten and put to flight. \"And now,\" said he, \"I will not make peace until the King gives me his daughter to wife, and I govern the whole kingdom in his name.\" He caused this to be announced to the King, and the latter said to his daughter, \"Necessity is a hard nut to crack, what remains to me but to do what he desires? If I want peace and to keep the crown on my head, I must give thee away.\"\n\nSo the wedding was celebrated, but the King\'s daughter was vexed that her husband should be a common man, who wore a shabby hat, and put on an old knapsack. She wished much to get rid of him, and night and day studied how she could accomplished this. Then she thought to herself, \"Is it possible that his wonderful powers lie in the knapsack?\" and she dissembled and caressed him, and when his heart was softened, she said, \"If thou wouldst but lay aside that ugly knapsack, it makes disfigures thee so, that I can\'t help being ashamed of thee.\" - \"Dear child,\" said he, \"this knapsack is my greatest treasure; as long as I have it, there is no power on earth that I am afraid of.\" And he revealed to her the wonderful virtue with which it was endowed. Then she threw herself in his arms as if she were going to kiss him, but dexterously took the knapsack off his shoulders, and ran away with it. As soon as she was alone she tapped it, and commanded the warriors to seize their former master, and take him out of the royal palace. They obeyed, and the false wife sent still more men after him, who were to drive him quite out of the country. Then he would have been ruined if he had not had the little hat. But his hands were scarcely at liberty before he turned it twice. Immediately the cannon began to thunder, and struck down everything, and the King\'s daughter herself was forced to come and beg for mercy. As she entreated in such moving terms, and promised amendment, he allowed himself to be persuaded and granted her peace. She behaved in a friendly manner to him, and acted as if she loved him very much, and after some time managed so to befool him, that he confided to her that even if someone got the knapsack into his power, he could do nothing against him so long as the old hat was still his. When she knew the secret, she waited until he was asleep, and then she took the hat away from him, and had it thrown out into the street. But the horn still remained to him, and in great anger he blew it with all his strength. Instantly all walls, fortifications, towns, and villages, toppled down, and crushed the King and his daughter to death. And had he not put down the horn and had blown just a little longer, everything would have been in ruins, and not one stone would have been left standing on another. Then no one opposed him any longer, and he made himself King of the whole country.</string>
    <string name="story362text">There were once a little brother and a little sister, who loved each other with all their hearts. Their own mother was, however, dead, and they had a stepmother, who was not kind to them, and secretly did everything she could to hurt them. It so happened that the two were playing with other children in a meadow before the house, and there was a pond in the meadow which came up to one side of the house. The children ran about it, and caught each other, and played at counting out.\n\n\"Eneke Beneke, let me live,\nAnd I to thee my bird will give.\nThe little bird, it straw shall seek,\nThe straw I\'ll give to the cow to eat.\nThe pretty cow shall give me milk,\nThe milk I\'ll to the baker take.\nThe baker he shall bake a cake,\nThe cake I\'ll give unto the cat.\nThe cat shall catch some mice for that,\nThe mice I\'ll hang up in the smoke,\nAnd then you\'ll see the snow.\"\n\nThey stood in a circle while they played this, and the one to whom the word \'snow\' fell, had to run away and all the others ran after him and caught him. As they were running about so merrily the stepmother watched them from the window, and grew angry. And as she understood arts of witchcraft she bewitched them both, and changed the little brother into a fish, and the little sister into a lamb. Then the fish swam here and there about the pond and was very sad, and the lambkin walked up and down the meadow, and was miserable, and could not eat or touch one blade of grass. Thus passed a long time, and then strangers came as visitors to the castle. The false step-mother thought: \"This is a good opportunity,\" and called the cook and said to him: \"Go and fetch the lamb from the meadow and kill it, we have nothing else for the visitors.\" Then the cook went away and got the lamb, and took it into the kitchen and tied its feet, and all this it bore patiently. When he had drawn out his knife and was whetting it on the door-step to kill the lamb, he noticed a little fish swimming backwards and forwards in the water, in front of the kitchen-sink and looking up at him. This, however, was the brother, for when the fish saw the cook take the lamb away, it followed them and swam along the pond to the house; then the lamb cried down to it:\n\n\"Ah, brother, in the pond so deep,\nHow sad is my poor heart!\nEven now the cook he whets his knife\nTo take away my tender life.\"\n\nThe little fish answered:\n\n\"Ah, little sister, up on hig\nHow sad is my poor heart\nWhile in this pond I lie.\"\n\nWhen the cook heard that the lambkin could speak and said such sad words to the fish down below, he was terrified and thought this could be no common lamb, but must be bewitched by the wicked woman in the house. Then said he: \"Be easy, I will not kill thee,\" and took another sheep and made it ready for the guests, and conveyed the lambkin to a good peasant woman, to whom he related all that he had seen and heard. The peasant was, however, the very woman who had been foster-mother to the little sister, and she suspected at once who the lamb was, and went with it to a wise woman. Then the wise woman pronounced a blessing over the lambkin and the little fish, by means of which they regained their human forms, and after this she took them both into a little hut in a great forest, where they lived alone, but were contented and happy.</string>
    <string name="story363text">Harry was lazy, and although he had nothing else to do but drive his goat daily to pasture, he nevertheless groaned when he went home after his day\'s work was done. \"It is indeed a heavy burden,\" said he, \"and a wearisome employment to drive a goat into the field this way year after year, till late into the autumn! If one could but lie down and sleep, but no, one must have one\'s eyes open lest it hurts the young trees, or squeezes itself through the hedge into a garden, or runs away altogether. How can one have any rest, or peace of one\'s life?\" He seated himself, collected his thoughts, and considered how he could set his shoulders free from this burden. For a long time all thinking was to no purpose, but suddenly it was as if scales fell from his eyes. \"I know what I will do,\" he cried, \"I will marry fat Trina who has also a goat, and can take mine out with hers, and then I shall have no more need to trouble myself.\"\nSo Harry got up, set his weary legs in motion, and went right across the street, for it was no farther, to where the parents of fat Trina lived, and asked for their industrious and virtuous daughter in marriage. The parents did not reflect long. \"Birds of a feather, flock together,\" they thought, and consented.\n\nSo fat Trina became Harry\'s wife, and led out both the goats. Harry had a good time of it, and had no work that he required to rest from but his own idleness. He only went out with her now and then, and said, \"I merely do it that I may afterwards enjoy rest more, otherwise one loses all feeling for it.\"\n\nBut fat Trina was no less idle. \"Dear Harry,\" said she one day, \"why should we make our lives so toilsome when there is no need for it, and thus ruin the best days of our youth? Would it not be better for us to give the two goats which disturb us every morning in our sweetest sleep with their bleating, to our neighbor, and he will give us a beehive for them. We will put the beehive in a sunny place behind the house, and trouble ourselves no more about it. Bees do not require to be taken care of, or driven into the field; they fly out and find the way home again for themselves, and collect honey without giving the very least trouble.\" - \"Thou hast spoken like a sensible woman,\" replied Harry. \"We will carry out thy proposal without delay, and besides all that, honey tastes better and nourishes one better than goat\'s milk, and it can be kept longer too.\"\n\nThe neighbor willingly gave a beehive for the two goats. The bees flew in and out from early morning till late evening without ever tiring, and filled the hive with the most beautiful honey, so that in autumn Harry was able to take a whole pitcherful out of it.\n\nThey placed the jug on a board which was fixed to the wall of their bed-room, and as they were afraid that it might be stolen from them, or that the mice might find it, Trina brought in a stout hazel-stick and put it beside her bed, so that without unnecessary getting up she might reach it with her hand, and drive away the uninvited guests. Lazy Harry did not like to leave his bed before noon. \"He who rises early,\" said he, \"wastes his substance.\"\n\nOne morning when he was still lying amongst the feathers in broad daylight, resting after his long sleep, he said to his wife, \"Women are fond of sweet things, and thou art always tasting the honey in private; it will be better for us to exchange it for a goose with a young gosling, before thou eatest up the whole of it.\" - \"But,\" answered Trina, \"not before we have a child to take care of them! Am I to worry myself with the little geese, and spend all my strength on them to no purpose.\" - \"Dost thou think,\" said Harry, \"that the youngster will look after geese? Now-a-days children no longer obey, they do according to their own fancy, because they consider themselves cleverer than their parents, just like that lad who was sent to seek the cow and chased three blackbirds.\" - \"Oh,\" replied Trina, \"this one shall fare badly if he does not do what I say! I will take a stick and belabour his skin for him with more blows than I can count. Look, Harry,\" cried she in her zeal, and seized the stick which she had to drive the mice away with, \"Look, this is the way I will fall on him!\" She reached her arm out to strike, but unhappily hit the honey-pitcher above the bed. The pitcher struck against the wall and fell down in fragments, and the fine honey streamed down on the ground. \"There lie the goose and the young gosling,\" said Harry, \"and want no looking after. But it is lucky that the pitcher did not fall on my head. We have all reason to be satisfied with our lot.\" And then as he saw that there was still some honey in one of the fragments he stretched out his hand for it, and said quite gaily, \"The remains, my wife, we will still eat with a relish, and we will rest a little after the fright we have had. What matters if we do get up a little later the day is always long enough.\" - \"Yes,\" answered Trina, \"we shall always get to the end of it at the proper time. Dost thou know that the snail was once asked to a wedding and set out to go, but arrived at the christening. In front of the house it fell over the fence, and said, \'Speed does no good.\'\"</string>
    <string name="story364text">In a certain village there once lived a man and his wife, and the wife was so idle that she would never work at anything; whatever her husband gave her to spin, she did not get done, and what she did spin she did not wind, but let it all remain entangled in a heap. If the man scolded her, she was always ready with her tongue, and said, \"Well, how should I wind it, when I have no reel? Just you go into the forest and get me one.\" - \"If that is all,\" said the man, \"then I will go into the forest, and get some wood for making reels.\" Then the woman was afraid that if he had the wood he would make her a reel of it, and she would have to wind her yarn off, and then begin to spin again. She bethought herself a little, and then a lucky idea occurred to her, and she secretly followed the man into the forest, and when he had climbed into a tree to choose and cut the wood, she crept into the thicket below where he could not see her, and cried,\n\n\"He who cuts wood for reels shall die,\nAnd he who winds, shall perish.\"\nThe man listened, laid down his axe for a moment, and began to consider what that could mean. \"Hollo,\" he said at last, \"what can that have been; my ears must have been singing, I won\'t alarm myself for nothing.\" So he again seized the axe, and began to hew, then again there came a cry from below:\n\n\"He who cuts wood for reels shall die,\nAnd he who winds, shall perish.\"\nHe stopped, and felt afraid and alarmed, and pondered over the circumstance. But when a few moments had passed, he took heart again, and a third time he stretched out his hand for the axe, and began to cut. But some one called out a third time, and said loudly,\n\n\"He who cuts wood for reels shall die,\nAnd he who winds, shall perish.\"\nThat was enough for him, and all inclination had departed from him, so he hastily descended the tree, and set out on his way home. The woman ran as fast as she could by by-ways so as to get home first. So when he entered the parlour, she put on an innocent look as if nothing had happened, and said, \"Well, have you brought a nice piece of wood for reels?\" - \"No,\" said he, \"I see very well that winding won\'t do,\" and told her what had happened to him in the forest, and from that time forth left her in peace about it. Nevertheless after some time, the man again began to complain of the disorder in the house. \"Wife,\" said he, \"it is really a shame that the spun yarn should lie there all entangled!\" - \"I\'ll tell you what,\" said she, \"as we still don\'t come by any reel, go you up into the loft, and I will stand down below, and will throw the yarn up to you, and you will throw it down to me, and so we shall get a skein after all.\" - \"Yes, that will do,\" said the man. So they did that, and when it was done, he said, \"The yarn is in skeins, now it must be boiled.\" The woman was again distressed; She certainly said, \"Yes, we will boil it next morning early.\" but she was secretly contriving another trick.\nEarly in the morning she got up, lighted a fire, and put the kettle on, only instead of the yarn, she put in a lump of tow, and let it boil. After that she went to the man who was still lying in bed, and said to him, \"I must just go out, you must get up and look after the yarn which is in the kettle on the fire, but you must be at hand at once; mind that, for if the cock should happen to crow, and you are not attending to the yarn, it will become tow.\" The man was willing and took good care not to loiter. He got up as quickly as he could, and went into the kitchen. But when he reached the kettle and peeped in, he saw, to his horror, nothing but a lump of tow. Then the poor man was as still as a mouse, thinking he had neglected it, and was to blame, and in future said no more about yarn and spinning. But you yourself must own she was an odious woman!\n</string>
    <string name="story366text">A tailor and a goldsmith were travelling together, and one evening when the sun had sunk behind the mountains, they heard the sound of distant music, which became more and more distinct. It sounded strange, but so pleasant that they forgot all their weariness and stepped quickly onwards. The moon had already arisen when they reached a hill on which they saw a crowd of little men and women, who had taken each other\'s hands, and were whirling round in the dance with the greatest pleasure and delight.\nThey sang to it most charmingly, and that was the music which the travellers had heard. In the midst of them sat an old man who was rather taller than the rest. He wore a parti-coloured coat, and his iron-grey beard hung down over his breast. The two remained standing full of astonishment, and watched the dance. The old man made a sign that they should enter, and the little folks willingly opened their circle. The goldsmith, who had a hump, and like all hunchbacks was brave enough, stepped in; the tailor felt a little afraid at first, and held back, but when he saw how merrily all was going, he plucked up his courage, and followed. The circle closed again directly, and the little folks went on singing and dancing with the wildest leaps. The old man, however, took a large knife which hung to his girdle, whetted it, and when it was sufficiently sharpened, he looked round at the strangers. They were terrified, but they had not much time for reflection, for the old man seized the goldsmith and with the greatest speed, shaved the hair of his head clean off, and then the same thing happened to the tailor. But their fear left them when, after he had finished his work, the old man clapped them both on the shoulder in a friendly manner, as much as to say, they had behaved well to let all that be done to them willingly, and without any struggle. He pointed with his finger to a heap of coals which lay at one side, and signified to the travellers by his gestures that they were to fill their pockets with them. Both of them obeyed, although they did not know of what use the coals would be to them, and then they went on their way to seek a shelter for the night. When they had got into the valley, the clock of the neighbouring monastery struck twelve, and the song ceased. In a moment all had vanished, and the hill lay in solitude in the moonlight.\n\nThe two travellers found an inn, and covered themselves up on their straw-beds with their coats, but in their weariness forgot to take the coals out of them before doing so. A heavy weight on their limbs awakened them earlier than usual. They felt in the pockets, and could not believe their eyes when they saw that they were not filled with coals, but with pure gold; happily, too, the hair of their heads and beards was there again as thick as ever.\n\nThey had now become rich folks, but the goldsmith, who, in accordance with his greedy disposition, had filled his pockets better, was as rich again as the tailor. A greedy man, even if he has much, still wishes to have more, so the goldsmith proposed to the tailor that they should wait another day, and go out again in the evening in order to bring back still greater treasures from the old man on the hill. The tailor refused, and said, \"I have enough and am content; now I shall be a master, and marry my dear object (for so he called his sweetheart), and I am a happy man.\" But he stayed another day to please him. In the evening the goldsmith hung a couple of bags over his shoulders that he might be able to stow away a great deal, and took the road to the hill. He found, as on the night before, the little folks at their singing and dancing, and the old man again shaved him clean, and signed to him to take some coal away with him. He was not slow about sticking as much into his bags as would go, went back quite delighted, and covered himself over with his coat. \"Even if the gold does weigh heavily,\" said he, \"I will gladly bear that,\" and at last he fell asleep with the sweet anticipation of waking in the morning an enormously rich man.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, he got up in haste to examine his pockets, but how amazed he was when he drew nothing out of them but black coals, and that howsoever often he put his hands in them. \"The gold I got the night before is still there for me,\" thought he, and went and brought it out, but how shocked he was when he saw that it likewise had again turned into coal. He smote his forehead with his dusty black hand, and then he felt that his whole head was bald and smooth, as was also the place where his beard should have been. But his misfortunes were not yet over; he now remarked for the first time that in addition to the hump on his back, a second, just as large, had grown in front on his breast. Then he recognized the punishment of his greediness, and began to weep aloud. The good tailor, who was wakened by this, comforted the unhappy fellow as well as he could, and said, \"Thou hast been my comrade in my travelling time; thou shalt stay with me and share in my wealth.\" He kept his word, but the poor goldsmith was obliged to carry the two humps as long as he lived, and to cover his bald head with a cap.</string>
    <string name="story367text">There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich peasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and yet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her, \"Hark you, I have a good thought, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it look like any other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.\" The woman also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head hanging down as if it were eating.\nNext morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant called the cow-herd and said, \"Look, I have a little calf there, but it is still small and has still to be carried.\" The cow-herd said, \"All right, and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set it among the grass.\" The little calf always remained standing like one which was eating, and the cow-herd said, \"It will soon run alone, just look how it eats already!\" At night when he was going to drive the herd home again, he said to the calf, \"If thou canst stand there and eat thy fill, thou canst also go on thy four legs; I don\'t care to drag thee home again in my arms.\" But the little peasant stood at his door, and waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The cow-herd answered, \"It is still standing out there eating. It would not stop and come with us.\" But the little peasant said, \"Oh, but I must have my beast back again.\" Then they went back to the meadow together, but some one had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said, \"It must have run away.\" The peasant, however, said, \"Don\'t tell me that,\" and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.\n\nAnd now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings, and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. As, however, the weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The miller\'s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant, \"Lay thyself on the straw there,\" and gave him a slice of bread with cheese on it. The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman thought, \"He is tired and has gone to sleep.\" In the meantime came the parson; the miller\'s wife received him well, and said, \"My husband is out, so we will have a feast.\" The peasant listened, and when he heard about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread with cheese on it. Then the woman served up four different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.\n\nJust as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking outside. The woman said, \"Oh, heavens! It is my husband!\" She quickly hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow, the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the cupboard in the entrance. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said, \"Thank heaven, thou art back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the world were coming to an end.\" The miller saw the peasant lying on the straw, and asked, \"What is that fellow doing there?\" - \"Ah,\" said the wife, \"the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where the straw was.\" The man said, \"I have no objection, but be quick and get me something to eat.\" The woman said, \"But I have nothing but bread and cheese.\" - \"I am contented with anything,\" replied the husband, \"so far as I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,\" and looked at the peasant and said, \"Come and eat some more with me.\" The peasant did not require to be invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin in which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked, \"What hast thou there?\" The peasant answered, \"I have a soothsayer inside it.\" - \"Can he foretell anything to me?\" said the miller. \"Why not?\" answered the peasant, \"but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to himself.\" The miller was curious, and said, \"Let him foretell something for once.\" Then the peasant pinched the raven\'s head, so that he croaked and made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said, \"What did he say?\" The peasant answered, \"In the first place, he says that there is some wine hidden under the pillow.\" - \"Bless me!\" cried the miller, and went there and found the wine. \"Now go on,\" said he. The peasant made the raven croak again, and said, \"In the second place, he says that there is some roast meat in the tiled stove.\" - \"Upon my word!\" cried the miller, and went thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven prophesy still more, and said, \"Thirdly, he says that there is some salad on the bed.\" - \"That would be a fine thing!\" cried the miller, and went there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven once more till he croaked, and said, \"Fourthly, he says that there are some cakes under the bed.\" - \"That would be a fine thing!\" cried the miller, and looked there, and found the cakes.\n\nAnd now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller\'s wife was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with her. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little peasant said, \"First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth is something bad.\" So they ate, and after that they bargained how much the miller was to give for the fifth prophesy, until they agreed on three hundred thalers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven\'s head till he croaked loudly. The miller asked, \"What did he say?\" The peasant replied, \"He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in the cupboard in the entrance.\" The miller said, \"The Devil must go out,\" and opened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys, and the peasant unlocked the cupboard. The parson ran out as fast as he could, and the miller said, \"It was true; I saw the black rascal with my own eyes.\" The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with the three hundred thalers.\n\nAt home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful house, and the peasants said, \"The small peasant has certainly been to the place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in shovels.\" Then the small peasant was brought before the Mayor, and bidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered, \"I sold my cow\'s skin in the town, for three hundred thalers.\" When the peasants heard that, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed all their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in the town to the greatest advantage. The Mayor, however, said, \"But my servant must go first.\" When she came to the merchant in the town, he did not give her more than two thalers for a skin, and when the others came, he did not give them so much, and said, \"What can I do with all these skins?\"\n\nThen the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus overreached them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this treachery before the Mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel pierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who was to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to a distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the man who had been with the miller\'s wife. He said to him, \"I set you free from the cupboard, set me free from the barrel.\" At this same moment up came, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd who as the peasant knew had long been wishing to be Mayor, so he cried with all his might, \"No, I will not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!\" The shepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked, \"What art thou about? What is it that thou wilt not do?\" The peasant said, \"They want to make me Mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.\" The shepherd said, \"If nothing more than that is needful in order to be Mayor, I would get into the barrel at once.\" The peasant said, \"If thou wilt get in, thou wilt be Mayor.\" The shepherd was willing, and got in, and the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd\'s flock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd, and declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the barrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd cried, \"I am quite willing to be Mayor.\" They believed no otherwise than that it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered, \"That is what we intend, but first thou shalt look about thee a little down below there,\" and they rolled the barrel down into the water.\n\nAfter that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the village, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of sheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished, and said, \"Peasant, from whence comest thou? Hast thou come out of the water?\" - \"Yes, truly,\" replied the peasant, \"I sank deep, deep down, until at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the barrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number of lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with me.\" Said the peasants, \"Are there any more there?\" - \"Oh, yes,\" said he, \"more than I could do anything with.\" Then the peasants made up their minds that they too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the Mayor said, \"I come first.\" So they went to the water together, and just then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which are called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon the peasants cried, \"We already see the sheep down below!\" The Mayor pressed forward and said, \"I will go down first, and look about me, and if things promise well I\'ll call you.\" So he jumped in; splash! went the water; he made a sound as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd plunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and the small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.</string>
    <string name="story368text">The Lord God had created all animals, and had chosen out the wolf to be his dog, but he had forgotten the goat. Then the Devil made ready and began to create also, and created goats with fine long tails. Now when they went to pasture, they generally remained caught in the hedges by their tails, then the Devil had to go there and disentangle them, with a great deal of trouble. This enraged him at last, and he went and bit off the tail of every goat, as may be seen to this day by the stump. Then he let them go to pasture alone, but it came to pass that the Lord God perceived how at one time they gnawed away at a fruitful tree, at another injured the noble vines, or destroyed other tender plants. This distressed him, so that in his goodness and mercy he summoned his wolves, who soon tore in pieces the goats that went there. When the devil observed this, he went before the Lord and said, \"Thy creatures have destroyed mine.\" The Lord answered, \"Why didst thou create things to do harm?\" The Devil said, \"I was compelled to do it: inasmuch as my thoughts run on evil, what I create can have no other nature, and thou must pay me heavy damages.\" - \"I will pay thee as soon as the oak leaves fall; come then, thy money will then be ready counted out.\" When the oak-leaves had fallen, the Devil came and demanded what was due to him. But the Lord said, \"In the church of Constantinople stands a tall oak-tree which still has all its leaves.\" With raging and curses, the Devil departed, and went to seek the oak, wandered in the wilderness for six months before he found it, and when he returned, all the oaks had in the meantime covered themselves again with green leaves. Then he had to forfeit his indemnity, and in his rage he put out the eyes of all the remaining goats, and put his own in instead.\nThis is why all goats have devil\'s eyes, and their tails bitten off, and why he likes to assume their shape.</string>
    <string name="story369text">A louse and a flea kept house together and were brewing beer in an egg-shell. Then the little louse fell in and burnt herself. On this the little flea began to scream loudly. Then said the little room-door: \"Little flea, why art thou screaming?\" – \"Because the louse has burnt herself.\"\n\nThen the little door began to creak. On this a little broom in the corner said: \"Why art thou creaking, little door?\" – \"Have I not reason to creak?\n\nThe little louse has burnt herself,\nThe little flea is weeping.\"\n\nSo the little broom began to sweep frantically. Then a little cart passed by and said: \"Why art thou sweeping, little broom?\" – \"Have I not reason to sweep?\n\nThe little louse has burnt herself,\nThe little flea is weeping,\nThe little door is creaking.\"\n\nSo the little cart said: \"Then I will run,\" and began to run wildly. Then said the ash-heap by which it ran: \"Why art thou running so, little cart?\" – \"Have I not reason to run?\n\nThe little louse has burnt herself,\nThe little flea is weeping,\nThe little door is creaking,\nThe little broom is sweeping.\"\n\nThe ash-heap said: \"Then I will burn furiously,\" and began to burn in clear flames. A little tree stood near the ash-heap and said: \"Ash-heap, why art thou burning?\" – \"Have I not reason to burn?\n\nThe little louse has burnt herself,\nThe little flea is weeping,\nThe little door is creaking,\nThe little broom is sweeping,\nThe little cart is running.\"\n\nThe little tree said: \"Then I will shake myself,\" and began to shake herself so that all her leaves fell off; a girl who came up with her water-pitcher saw that, and said: \"Little tree, why art thou shaking thyself?\" – \"Have I not reason to shake myself?\n\nThe little louse has burnt herself,\nThe little flea is weeping,\nThe little door is creaking,\nThe little broom is sweeping,\nThe little cart is running,\nThe little ash-heap is burning.\"\n\nOn this the girl said: \"Then I will break my little water-pitcher,\" and she broke her little water-pitcher. Then said the little spring from which ran the water: \"Girl, why art thou breaking thy water-jug?\" – \"Have I not reason to break my water-jug?\n\nThe little louse has burnt herself,\nThe little flea is weeping,\nThe little door is creaking,\nThe little broom is sweeping,\nThe little cart is running,\nThe little ash-heap is burning,\nThe little tree is shaking itself.\"\n\n\"Oh, ho,\" said the spring, \"then I will begin to flow,\" and began to flow violently. And in the water everything was drowned, the girl, the little tree, the little ash-heap, the little cart, the broom, the little door, the little flea, the little louse, all together.</string>
    <string name="story370text">There was once a King who had a son who asked in marriage the daughter of a mighty King; she was called Maid Maleen, and was very beautiful. As her father wished to give her to another, the prince was rejected; but as they both loved each other with all their hearts, they would not give each other up, and Maid Maleen said to her father, \"I can and will take no other for my husband.\" Then the King flew into a passion, and ordered a dark tower to be built, into which no ray of sunlight or moonlight should enter. When it was finished, he said, \"Therein shalt thou be imprisoned for seven years, and then I will come and see if thy perverse spirit is broken.\" Meat and drink for the seven years were carried into the tower, and then she and her waiting-woman were led into it and walled up, and thus cut off from the sky and from the earth. There they sat in the darkness, and knew not when day or night began. The King\'s son often went round and round the tower, and called their names, but no sound from without pierced through the thick walls. What else could they do but lament and complain? Meanwhile the time passed, and by the diminution of the food and drink they knew that the seven years were coming to an end. They thought the moment of their deliverance was come; but no stroke of the hammer was heard, no stone fell out of the wall, and it seemed to Maid Maleen that her father had forgotten her. As they only had food for a short time longer, and saw a miserable death awaiting them, Maid Maleen said, \"We must try our last chance, and see if we can break through the wall.\" She took the bread-knife, and picked and bored at the mortar of a stone, and when she was tired, the waiting-maid took her turn. With great labour they succeeded in getting out one stone, and then a second, and a third, and when three days were over the first ray of light fell on their darkness, and at last the opening was so large that they could look out. The sky was blue, and a fresh breeze played on their faces; but how melancholy everything looked all around! Her father\'s castle lay in ruins, the town and the villages were, so far as could be seen, destroyed by fire, the fields far and wide laid to waste, and no human being was visible. When the opening in the wall was large enough for them to slip through, the waiting-maid sprang down first, and then Maid Maleen followed. But where were they to go? The enemy had ravaged the whole kingdom, driven away the King, and slain all the inhabitants. They wandered forth to seek another country, but nowhere did they find a shelter, or a human being to give them a mouthful of bread, and their need was so great that they were forced to appease their hunger with nettles. When, after long journeying, they came into another country, they tried to get work everywhere; but wherever they knocked they were turned away, and no one would have pity on them. At last they arrived in a large city and went to the royal palace. There also they were ordered to go away, but at last the cook said that they might stay in the kitchen and be scullions.\nThe son of the King in whose kingdom they were, was, however, the very man who had been betrothed to Maid Maleen. His father had chosen another bride for him, whose face was as ugly as her heart was wicked. The wedding was fixed, and the maiden had already arrived; but because of her great ugliness, however, she shut herself in her room, and allowed no one to see her, and Maid Maleen had to take her her meals from the kitchen. When the day came for the bride and the bridegroom to go to church, she was ashamed of her ugliness, and afraid that if she showed herself in the streets, she would be mocked and laughed at by the people. Then said she to Maid Maleen, \"A great piece of luck has befallen thee. I have sprained my foot, and cannot well walk through the streets; thou shalt put on my wedding-clothes and take my place; a greater honour than that thou canst not have!\" Maid Maleen, however, refused it, and said, \"I wish for no honour which is not suitable for me.\" It was in vain, too, that the bride offered her gold. At last she said angrily, \"If thou dost not obey me, it shall cost thee thy life. I have but to speak the word, and thy head will lie at thy feet.\" Then she was forced to obey, and put on the bride\'s magnificent clothes and all her jewels. When she entered the royal hall, every one was amazed at her great beauty, and the King said to his son, \"This is the bride whom I have chosen for thee, and whom thou must lead to church.\" The bridegroom was astonished, and thought, \"She is like my Maid Maleen, and I should believe that it was she herself, but she has long been shut up in the tower, or dead.\" He took her by the hand and led her to church. On the way was a nettle-plant, and she said,\n\n\"Oh, nettle-plant,\nLittle nettle-plant,\nWhat dost thou here alone?\nI have known the time\nWhen I ate thee unboiled,\nWhen I ate thee unroasted.\"\n\"What art thou saying?\" asked the King\'s son. \"Nothing,\" she replied, \"I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.\" He was surprised that she knew about her, but kept silence. When they came to the foot-plank into the churchyard, she said,\n\"Foot-bridge, do not break,\nI am not the true bride.\"\n\"What art thou saying there?\" asked the King\'s son. \"Nothing,\" she replied, \"I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.\" - \"Dost thou know Maid Maleen?\" - \"No,\" she answered, \"how should I know her; I have only heard of her.\" When they came to the church-door, she said once more,\n\n\"Church-door, break not,\nI am not the true bride.\"\n\"What art thou saying there?\" asked he. \"Ah,\" she answered, \"I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.\" Then he took out a precious chain, put it round her neck, and fastened the clasp. Thereupon they entered the church, and the priest joined their hands together before the altar, and married them. He led her home, but she did not speak a single word the whole way. When they got back to the royal palace, she hurried into the bride\'s chamber, put off the magnificent clothes and the jewels, dressed herself in her gray gown, and kept nothing but the jewel on her neck, which she had received from the bridegroom.\nWhen the night came, and the bride was to be led into the prince\'s apartment, she let her veil fall over her face, that he might not observe the deception. As soon as every one had gone away, he said to her, \"What didst thou say to the nettle-plant which was growing by the wayside?\"\n\n\"To which nettle-plant?\" asked she; \"I don\'t talk to nettle-plants.\" - \"If thou didst not do it, then thou art not the true bride,\" said he. So she bethought herself, and said,\n\n\"I must go out unto my maid,\nWho keeps my thoughts for me.\"\nShe went out and sought Maid Maleen. \"Girl, what hast thou been saying to the nettle?\" - \"I said nothing but,\n\n\"Oh, nettle-plant,\nLittle nettle-plant,\nWhat dost thou here alone?\nI have known the time\nWhen I ate thee unboiled,\nWhen I ate thee unroasted.\"\nThe bride ran back into the chamber, and said, \"I know now what I said to the nettle,\" and she repeated the words which she had just heard. \"But what didst thou say to the foot-bridge when we went over it?\" asked the King\'s son. \"To the foot-bridge?\" she answered. \"I don\'t talk to foot-bridges.\" - \"Then thou art not the true bride.\"\nShe again said,\n\n\n\"I must go out unto my maid,\nWho keeps my thoughts for me,\"\nAnd ran out and found Maid Maleen, \"Girl, what didst thou say to the foot-bridge?\"\n\"I said nothing but,\n\n\n\"Foot-bridge, do not break,\nI am not the true bride.\"\n\"That costs thee thy life!\" cried the bride, but she hurried into the room, and said, \"I know now what I said to the foot-bridge,\" and she repeated the words. \"But what didst thou say to the church-door?\" - \"To the church-door?\" she replied; \"I don\'t talk to church-doors.\" - \"Then thou art not the true bride.\"\nShe went out and found Maid Maleen, and said, \"Girl, what didst thou say to the church-door?\"\n\n\"I said nothing but,\n\n\"Church-door, break not,\nI am not the true bride.\"\n\"That will break thy neck for thee!\" cried the bride, and flew into a terrible passion, but she hastened back into the room, and said, \"I know now what I said to the church-door,\" and she repeated the words. \"But where hast thou the jewel which I gave thee at the church-door?\" - \"What jewel?\" she answered; \"thou didst not give me any jewel.\" - \"I myself put it round thy neck, and I myself fastened it; if thou dost not know that, thou art not the true bride.\" He drew the veil from her face, and when he saw her immeasurable ugliness, he sprang back terrified, and said, \"How comest thou here? Who art thou?\" - \"I am thy betrothed bride, but because I feared lest the people should mock me when they saw me out of doors, I commanded the scullery-maid to dress herself in my clothes, and to go to church instead of me.\" - \"Where is the girl?\" said he; \"I want to see her, go and bring her here.\" She went out and told the servants that the scullery-maid was an impostor, and that they must take her out into the court-yard and strike off her head. The servants laid hold of Maid Maleen and wanted to drag her out, but she screamed so loudly for help, that the King\'s son heard her voice, hurried out of his chamber and ordered them to set the maiden free instantly. Lights were brought, and then he saw on her neck the gold chain which he had given her at the church-door. \"Thou art the true bride, said he, \"who went with me to the church; come with me now to my room.\" When they were both alone, he said, \"On the way to church thou didst name Maid Maleen, who was my betrothed bride; if I could believe it possible, I should think she was standing before me thou art like her in every respect.\" She answered, \"I am Maid Maleen, who for thy sake was imprisoned seven years in the darkness, who suffered hunger and thirst, and has lived so long in want and poverty. To-day, however, the sun is shining on me once more. I was married to thee in the church, and I am thy lawful wife.\" Then they kissed each other, and were happy all the days of their lives. The false bride was rewarded for what she had done by having her head cut off.\nThe tower in which Maid Maleen had been imprisoned remained standing for a long time, and when the children passed by it they sang,\n\n\"Kling, klang, gloria.\nWho sits within this tower?\nA King\'s daughter, she sits within,\nA sight of her I cannot win,\nThe wall it will not break,\nThe stone cannot be pierced.\nLittle Hans, with your coat so gay,\nFollow me, follow me, fast as you may.\"\n</string>
    <string name="story371text">Master Pfriem was a short, thin, but lively man, who never rested a moment. His face, of which his turned-up nose was the only prominent feature, was marked with small-pox and pale as death, his hair was gray and shaggy, his eyes small, but they glanced perpetually about on all sides. He saw everything, criticised everything, knew everything best, and was always in the right. When he went into the streets, he moved his arms about as if he were rowing; and once he struck the pail of a girl, who was carrying water, so high in the air that he himself was wetted all over by it. \"Stupid thing,\" cried he to her, while he was shaking himself, \"couldst thou not see that I was coming behind thee?\" By trade he was a shoemaker, and when he worked he pulled his thread out with such force that he drove his fist into every one who did not keep far enough off. No apprentice stayed more than a month with him, for he had always some fault to find with the very best work. At one time it was that the stitches were not even, at another that one shoe was too long, or one heel higher than the other, or the leather not cut large enough. \"Wait,\" said he to his apprentice, \"I will soon show thee how we make skins soft,\" and he brought a strap and gave him a couple of strokes across the back. He called them all sluggards. He himself did not turn much work out of his hands, for he never sat still for a quarter of an hour. If his wife got up very early in the morning and lighted the fire, he jumped out of bed, and ran bare-footed into the kitchen, crying, \"Wilt thou burn my house down for me? That is a fire one could roast an ox by! Does wood cost nothing?\" If the servants were standing by their wash-tubs and laughing, and telling each other all they knew, he scolded them, and said, \"There stand the geese cackling, and forgetting their work, to gossip! And why fresh soap? Disgraceful extravagance and shameful idleness into the bargain! They want to save their hands, and not rub the things properly!\" And out he would run and knock a pail full of soap and water over, so that the whole kitchen was flooded. Someone was building a new house, so he hurried to the window to look on. \"There, they are using that red sand-stone again that never dries!\" cried he. \"No one will ever be healthy in that house! and just look how badly the fellows are laying the stones! Besides, the mortar is good for nothing! It ought to have gravel in it, not sand. I shall live to see that house tumble down on the people who are in it.\" He sat down, put a couple of stitches in, and then jumped up again, unfastened his leather-apron, and cried, \"I will just go out, and appeal to those men\'s consciences.\" He stumbled on the carpenters. \"What\'s this?\" cried he, \"you are not working by the line! Do you expect the beams to be straight?—one wrong will put all wrong.\" He snatched an axe out of a carpenter\'s hand and wanted to show him how he ought to cut; but as a cart loaded with clay came by, he threw the axe away, and hastened to the peasant who was walking by the side of it: \"You are not in your right mind,\" said he, \"who yokes young horses to a heavily-laden cart? The poor beasts will die on the spot.\" The peasant did not give him an answer, and Pfriem in a rage ran back into his workshop. When he was setting himself to work again, the apprentice reached him a shoe. \"Well, what\'s that again?\" screamed he, \"Haven\'t I told you you ought not to cut shoes so broad? Who would buy a shoe like this, which is hardly anything else but a sole? I insist on my orders being followed exactly.\" Master,\" answered the apprentice, \"you may easily be quite right about the shoe being a bad one, but it is the one which you yourself cut out, and yourself set to work at. When you jumped up a while since, you knocked it off the table, and I have only just picked it up. An angel from heaven, however, would never make you believe that.\"\nOne night Master Pfriem dreamed he was dead, and on his way to heaven. When he got there, he knocked loudly at the door. \"I wonder,\" said he to himself, \"that they have no knocker on the door, — one knocks one\'s knuckles sore.\" The apostle Peter opened the door, and wanted to see who demanded admission so noisily. \"Ah, it\'s you, Master Pfriem;\" said he, \"well, I\'ll let you in, but I warn you that you must give up that habit of yours, and find fault with nothing you see in heaven, or you may fare ill.\" - \"You might have spared your warning,\" answered Pfriem. \"I know already what is seemly, and here, God be thanked, everything is perfect, and there is nothing to blame as there is on earth.\" So he went in, and walked up and down the wide expanses of heaven. He looked around him, to the left and to the right, but sometimes shook his head, or muttered something to himself. Then he saw two angels who were carrying away a beam. It was the beam which some one had had in his own eye whilst he was looking for the splinter in the eye of another. They did not, however, carry the beam lengthways, but obliquely. \"Did any one ever see such a piece of stupidity?\" thought Master Pfriem; but he said nothing, and seemed satisfied with it. \"It comes to the same thing after all, whichever way they carry the beam, straight or crooked, if they only get along with it, and truly I do not see them knock against anything.\" Soon after this he saw two angels who were drawing water out of a well into a bucket, but at the same time he observed that the bucket was full of holes, and that the water was running out of it on every side. They were watering the earth with rain. \"Hang it,\" he exclaimed; but happily recollected himself, and thought, \"Perhaps it is only a pastime. If it is an amusement, then it seems they can do useless things of this kind even here in heaven, where people, as I have already noticed, do nothing but idle about.\" He went farther and saw a cart which had stuck fast in a deep hole. \"It\'s no wonder,\" said he to the man who stood by it; \"who would load so unreasonably? what have you there?\" - \"Good wishes,\" replied the man, \"I could not go along the right way with it, but still I have pushed it safely up here, and they won\'t leave me sticking here.\" In fact an angel did come and harnessed two horses to it. \"That\'s quite right,\" thought Pfriem, \"but two horses won\'t get that cart out, it must at least have four to it.\" Another angel came and brought two more horses; she did not, however, harness them in front of it, but behind. That was too much for Master Pfriem, \"Clumsy creature,\" he burst out with, \"what are you doing there? Has any one ever since the world began seen a cart drawn in that way? But you, in your conceited arrogance, think that you know everything best.\" He was going to say more, but one of the inhabitants of heaven seized him by the throat and pushed him forth with irresistible strength. Beneath the gateway Master Pfriem turned his head round to take one more look at the cart, and saw that it was being raised into the air by four winged horses.\n\nAt this moment Master Pfriem awoke. \"Things are certainly arranged in heaven otherwise than they are on earth,\" said he to himself, \"and that excuses much; but who can see horses harnessed both behind and before with patience; to be sure they had wings, but who could know that? It is, besides, great folly to fix a pair of wings to a horse that has four legs to run with already! But I must get up, or else they will make nothing but mistakes for me in my house. It is a lucky thing for me though, that I am not really dead.\"</string>
    <string name="story372text">One day an old man and his wife were sitting in front of a miserable house resting a while from their work. Suddenly a splendid carriage with four black horses came driving up, and a richly-dressed man descended from it. The peasant stood up, went to the great man, and asked what he wanted, and in what way he could be useful to him? The stranger stretched out his hand to the old man, and said, \"I want nothing but to enjoy for once a country dish; cook me some potatoes, in the way you always have them, and then I will sit down at your table and eat them with pleasure.\" The peasant smiled and said, \"You are a count or a prince, or perhaps even a duke; noble gentlemen often have such fancies, but you shall have your wish.\" The wife went into the kitchen, and began to wash and rub the potatoes, and to make them into balls, as they are eaten by the country-folks. Whilst she was busy with this work, the peasant said to the stranger, \"Come into my garden with me for a while, I have still something to do there.\" He had dug some holes in the garden, and now wanted to plant some trees in them. \"Have you no children,\" asked the stranger, \"who could help you with your work?\" - \"No,\" answered the peasant, \"I had a son, it is true, but it is long since he went out into the world. He was a ne\'er-do-well; sharp, and knowing, but he would learn nothing and was full of bad tricks, at last he ran away from me, and since then I have heard nothing of him.\"\nThe old man took a young tree, put it in a hole, drove in a post beside it, and when he had shovelled in some earth and had trampled it firmly down, he tied the stem of the tree above, below, and in the middle, fast to the post by a rope of straw. \"But tell me,\" said the stranger, \"why you don\'t tie that crooked knotted tree, which is lying in the corner there, bent down almost to the ground, to a post also that it may grow straight, as well as these?\" The old man smiled and said, \"Sir, you speak according to your knowledge, it is easy to see that you are not familiar with gardening. That tree there is old, and mis-shapen, no one can make it straight now. Trees must be trained while they are young.\" - \"That is how it was with your son,\" said the stranger, \"if you had trained him while he was still young, he would not have run away; now he too must have grown hard and mis-shapen.\" - \"Truly it is a long time since he went away,\" replied the old man, \"he must have changed.\" - \"Would you know him again if he were to come to you?\" asked the stranger. \"Hardly by his face,\" replied the peasant, \"but he has a mark about him, a birth-mark on his shoulder, that looks like a bean.\" When he had said that the stranger pulled off his coat, bared his shoulder, and showed the peasant the bean. \"Good God!\" cried the old man, \"Thou art really my son!\" and love for his child stirred in his heart. \"But,\" he added, \"how canst thou be my son, thou hast become a great lord and livest in wealth and luxury? How hast thou contrived to do that?\" - \"Ah, father,\" answered the son, \"the young tree was bound to no post and has grown crooked, now it is too old, it will never be straight again. How have I got all that? I have become a thief, but do not be alarmed, I am a master-thief. For me there are neither locks nor bolts, whatsoever I desire is mine. Do not imagine that I steal like a common thief, I only take some of the superfluity of the rich. Poor people are safe, I would rather give to them than take anything from them. It is the same with anything which I can have without trouble, cunning and dexterity I never touch it.\" - \"Alas, my son,\" said the father, \"it still does not please me, a thief is still a thief, I tell thee it will end badly.\" He took him to his mother, and when she heard that was her son, she wept for joy, but when he told her that he had become a master-thief, two streams flowed down over her face. At length she said, \"Even if he has become a thief, he is still my son, and my eyes have beheld him once more.\" They sat down to table, and once again he ate with his parents the wretched food which he had not eaten for so long. The father said, \"If our Lord, the count up there in the castle, learns who thou art, and what trade thou followest, he will not take thee in his arms and cradle thee in them as he did when he held thee at the font, but will cause thee to swing from a halter.\" - \"Be easy, father, he will do me no harm, for I understand my trade. I will go to him myself this very day.\" When evening drew near, the master-thief seated himself in his carriage, and drove to the castle. The count received him civilly, for he took him for a distinguished man. When, however, the stranger made himself known, the count turned pale and was quite silent for some time. At length he said, \"Thou art my godson, and on that account mercy shall take the place of justice, and I will deal leniently with thee. Since thou pridest thyself on being a master-thief, I will put thy art to the proof, but if thou dost not stand the test, thou must marry the rope-maker\'s daughter, and the croaking of the raven must be thy music on the occasion.\" - \"Lord count,\" answered the master-thief, \"Think of three things, as difficult as you like, and if I do not perform your tasks, do with me what you will.\" The count reflected for some minutes, and then said, \"Well, then, in the first place, thou shalt steal the horse I keep for my own riding, out of the stable; in the next, thou shalt steal the sheet from beneath the bodies of my wife and myself when we are asleep, without our observing it, and the wedding-ring of my wife as well; thirdly and lastly, thou shalt steal away out of the church, the parson and clerk. Mark what I am saying, for thy life depends on it.\"\n\nThe master-thief went to the nearest town; there he bought the clothes of an old peasant woman, and put them on. Then he stained his face brown, and painted wrinkles on it as well, so that no one could have recognized him. Then he filled a small cask with old Hungary wine in which was mixed a powerful sleeping-drink. He put the cask in a basket, which he took on his back, and walked with slow and tottering steps to the count\'s castle. It was already dark when he arrived. He sat down on a stone in the court-yard and began to cough, like an asthmatic old woman, and to rub his hands as if he were cold. In front of the door of the stable some soldiers were lying round a fire; one of them observed the woman, and called out to her, \"Come nearer, old mother, and warm thyself beside us. After all, thou hast no bed for the night, and must take one where thou canst find it.\" The old woman tottered up to them, begged them to lift the basket from her back, and sat down beside them at the fire. \"What hast thou got in thy little cask, old lady?\" asked one. \"A good mouthful of wine,\" she answered. \"I live by trade, for money and fair words I am quite ready to let you have a glass.\" - \"Let us have it here, then,\" said the soldier, and when he had tasted one glass he said, \"When wine is good, I like another glass,\" and had another poured out for himself, and the rest followed his example. \"Hallo, comrades,\" cried one of them to those who were in the stable, \"here is an old goody who has wine that is as old as herself; take a draught, it will warm your stomachs far better than our fire.\" The old woman carried her cask into the stable. One of the soldiers had seated himself on the saddled riding-horse, another held its bridle in his hand, a third had laid hold of its tail. She poured out as much as they wanted until the spring ran dry. It was not long before the bridle fell from the hand of the one, and he fell down and began to snore, the other left hold of the tail, lay down and snored still louder. The one who was sitting in the saddle, did remain sitting, but bent his head almost down to the horse\'s neck, and slept and blew with his mouth like the bellows of a forge. The soldiers outside had already been asleep for a long time, and were lying on the ground motionless, as if dead. When the master-thief saw that he had succeeded, he gave the first a rope in his hand instead of the bridle, and the other who had been holding the tail, a wisp of straw, but what was he to do with the one who was sitting on the horse\'s back? He did not want to throw him down, for he might have awakened and have uttered a cry. He had a good idea, he unbuckled the girths of the saddle, tied a couple of ropes which were hanging to a ring on the wall fast to the saddle, and drew the sleeping rider up into the air on it, then he twisted the rope round the posts, and made it fast. He soon unloosed the horse from the chain, but if he had ridden over the stony pavement of the yard they would have heard the noise in the castle. So he wrapped the horse\'s hoofs in old rags, led him carefully out, leapt upon him, and galloped off.\n\nWhen day broke, the master galloped to the castle on the stolen horse. The count had just got up, and was looking out of the window. \"Good morning, Sir Count,\" he cried to him, \"here is the horse, which I have got safely out of the stable! Just look, how beautifully your soldiers are lying there sleeping; and if you will but go into the stable, you will see how comfortable your watchers have made it for themselves.\" The count could not help laughing, then he said, \"For once thou hast succeeded, but things won\'t go so well the second time, and I warn thee that if thou comest before me as a thief, I will handle thee as I would a thief.\" When the countess went to bed that night, she closed her hand with the wedding-ring tightly together, and the count said, \"All the doors are locked and bolted, I will keep awake and wait for the thief, but if he gets in by the window, I will shoot him.\" The master-thief, however, went in the dark to the gallows, cut a poor sinner who was hanging there down from the halter, and carried him on his back to the castle. Then he set a ladder up to the bedroom, put the dead body on his shoulders, and began to climb up. When he had got so high that the head of the dead man showed at the window, the count, who was watching in his bed, fired a pistol at him, and immediately the master let the poor sinner fall down, and hid himself in one corner. The night was sufficiently lighted by the moon, for the master to see distinctly how the count got out of the window on to the ladder, came down, carried the dead body into the garden, and began to dig a hole in which to lay it. \"Now,\" thought the thief, \"the favourable moment has come,\" stole nimbly out of his corner, and climbed up the ladder straight into the countess\'s bedroom. \"Dear wife,\" he began in the count\'s voice, \"the thief is dead, but, after all, he is my godson, and has been more of a scape-grace than a villain. I will not put him to open shame; besides, I am sorry for the parents. I will bury him myself before daybreak, in the garden that the thing may not be known, so give me the sheet, I will wrap up the body in it, and bury him as a dog burries things by scratching.\" The countess gave him the sheet. \"I tell you what,\" continued the thief, \"I have a fit of magnanimity on me, give me the ring too, — the unhappy man risked his life for it, so he may take it with him into his grave.\" She would not gainsay the count, and although she did it unwillingly she drew the ring from her finger, and gave it to him. The thief made off with both these things, and reached home safely before the count in the garden had finished his work of burying.\n\nWhat a long face the count did pull when the master came next morning, and brought him the sheet and the ring. \"Art thou a wizard?\" said he, \"Who has fetched thee out of the grave in which I myself laid thee, and brought thee to life again?\" - \"You did not bury me,\" said the thief, \"but the poor sinner on the gallows,\" and he told him exactly how everything had happened, and the count was forced to own to him that he was a clever, crafty thief. \"But thou hast not reached the end yet,\" he added, \"thou hast still to perform the third task, and if thou dost not succeed in that, all is of no use.\" The master smiled and returned no answer. When night had fallen he went with a long sack on his back, a bundle under his arms, and a lantern in his hand to the village-church. In the sack he had some crabs, and in the bundle short wax-candles. He sat down in the churchyard, took out a crab, and stuck a wax-candle on his back. Then he lighted the little light, put the crab on the ground, and let it creep about. He took a second out of the sack, and treated it in the same way, and so on until the last was out of the sack. Hereupon he put on a long black garment that looked like a monk\'s cowl, and stuck a gray beard on his chin. When at last he was quite unrecognizable, he took the sack in which the crabs had been, went into the church, and ascended the pulpit. The clock in the tower was just striking twelve; when the last stroke had sounded, he cried with a loud and piercing voice, \"Hearken, sinful men, the end of all things has come! The last day is at hand! Hearken! Hearken! Whosoever wishes to go to heaven with me must creep into the sack. I am Peter, who opens and shuts the gate of heaven. Behold how the dead outside there in the churchyard, are wandering about collecting their bones. Come, come, and creep into the sack; the world is about to be destroyed!\" The cry echoed through the whole village. The parson and clerk who lived nearest to the church, heard it first, and when they saw the lights which were moving about the churchyard, they observed that something unusual was going on, and went into the church. They listened to the sermon for a while, and then the clerk nudged the parson and said, \"It would not be amiss if we were to use the opportunity together, and before the dawning of the last day, find an easy way of getting to heaven.\" - \"To tell the truth,\" answered the parson, \"that is what I myself have been thinking, so if you are inclined, we will set out on our way.\" - \"Yes,\" answered the clerk, \"but you, the pastor, have the precedence, I will follow.\" So the parson went first, and ascended the pulpit where the master opened his sack. The parson crept in first, and then the clerk. The master immediately tied up the sack tightly, seized it by the middle, and dragged it down the pulpit-steps, and whenever the heads of the two fools bumped against the steps, he cried, \"We are going over the mountains.\" Then he drew them through the village in the same way, and when they were passing through puddles, he cried, \"Now we are going through wet clouds.\" And when at last he was dragging them up the steps of the castle, he cried, \"Now we are on the steps of heaven, and will soon be in the outer court.\" When he had got to the top, he pushed the sack into the pigeon-house, and when the pigeons fluttered about, he said, \"Hark how glad the angels are, and how they are flapping their wings!\" Then he bolted the door upon them, and went away.\n\nNext morning he went to the count, and told him that he had performed the third task also, and had carried the parson and clerk out of the church. \"Where hast thou left them?\" asked the lord. \"They are lying upstairs in a sack in the pigeon-house, and imagine that they are in heaven.\" The count went up himself, and convinced himself that the master had told the truth. When he had delivered the parson and clerk from their captivity, he said, \"Thou art an arch-thief, and hast won thy wager. For once thou escapest with a whole skin, but see that thou leavest my land, for if ever thou settest foot on it again, thou may\'st count on thy elevation to the gallows.\" The arch-thief took leave of his parents, once more went forth into the wide world, and no one has ever heard of him since.\n\n</string>
    <string name="story373text">In days gone by there was a land where the nights were always dark, and the sky spread over it like a black cloth, for there the moon never rose, and no star shone in the obscurity. At the creation of the world, the light at night had been sufficient. Three young fellows once went out of this country on a travelling expedition, and arrived in another kingdom, where, in the evening when the sun had disappeared behind the mountains, a shining globe was placed on an oak-tree, which shed a soft light far and wide. By means of this, everything could very well be seen and distinguished, even though it was not so brilliant as the sun. The travellers stopped and asked a countryman who was driving past with his cart, what kind of a light that was. \"That is the moon,\" answered he; our mayor bought it for three thalers, and fastened it to the oak-tree. He has to pour oil into it daily, and to keep it clean, so that it may always burn clearly. He receives a thaler a week from us for doing it.\"\nWhen the countryman had driven away, one of them said, \"We could make some use of this lamp, we have an oak-tree at home, which is just as big as this, and we could hang it on that. What a pleasure it would be not to have to feel about at night in the darkness!\" - \"I\'ll tell you what we\'ll do,\" said the second; \"we will fetch a cart and horses and carry away the moon. The people here may buy themselves another.\" - \"I\'m a good climber,\" said the third, \"I will bring it down.\" The fourth brought a cart and horses, and the third climbed the tree, bored a hole in the moon, passed a rope through it, and let it down. When the shining ball lay in the cart, they covered it over with a cloth, that no one might observe the theft. They conveyed it safely into their own country, and placed it on a high oak. Old and young rejoiced, when the new lamp let its light shine over the whole land, and bed-rooms and sitting-rooms were filled with it. The dwarfs came forth from their caves in the rocks, and the tiny elves in their little red coats danced in rings on the meadows.\n\nThe four took care that the moon was provided with oil, cleaned the wick, and received their weekly thaler, but they became old men, and when one of them grew ill, and saw that he was about to die, he appointed that one quarter of the moon, should, as his property, be laid in the grave with him. When he died, the mayor climbed up the tree, and cut off a quarter with the hedge-shears, and this was placed in his coffin. The light of the moon decreased, but still not visibly. When the second died, the second quarter was buried with him, and the light diminished. It grew weaker still after the death of the third, who likewise took his part of it away with him; and when the fourth was borne to his grave, the old state of darkness recommenced, and whenever the people went out at night without their lanterns they knocked their heads together.\n\nWhen, however, the pieces of the moon had united themselves together again in the world below, where darkness had always prevailed, it came to pass that the dead became restless and awoke from their sleep. They were astonished when they were able to see again; the moonlight was quite sufficient for them, for their eyes had become so weak that they could not have borne the brilliance of the sun. They rose up and were merry, and fell into their former ways of living. Some of them went to the play and to dance, others hastened to the public-houses, where they asked for wine, got drunk, brawled, quarreled, and at last took up cudgels, and belabored each other. The noise became greater and greater, and at last reached even to heaven.\n\nSaint Peter who guards the gate of heaven thought the lower world had broken out in revolt and gathered together the heavenly troops, which are to drive back the Evil One when he and his associates storm the abode of the blessed. As these, however, did not come, he got on his horse and rode through the gate of heaven, down into the world below. There he reduced the dead to subjection, bade them lie down in their graves again, took the moon away with him, and hung it up in heaven.</string>
    <string name="story374text">A widow had two daughters; one was pretty and industrious, the other was ugly and lazy. And as the ugly one was her own daughter, she loved her much the best, and the pretty one was made to do all the work, and be the drudge of the house. Every day the poor girl had to sit by a well on the high road and spin until her fingers bled. Now it happened once that as the spindle was bloody, she dipped it into the well to wash it; but it slipped out of her hand and fell in. Then she began to cry, and ran to her step-mother, and told her of her misfortune; and her stepmother scolded her without mercy, and said in her rage: \"As you have let the spindle fall in, you must go and fetch it out again!\" Then the girl went back again to the well, not knowing what to do, and in the despair of her heart she jumped down into the well the same way the spindle had gone. After that she knew nothing; and when she came to herself she was in a beautiful meadow, and the sun was shining on the flowers that grew round her. And she walked on through the meadow until she came to a baker\'s oven that was full of bread; and the bread called out to her: \"Oh, take me out, take me out, or I shall burn; I am baked enough already!\" Then she drew near, and with the baker\'s peel she took out all the loaves one after the other. And she went farther on till she came to a tree weighed down with apples, and it called out to her: \"Oh, shake me, shake me, we apples are all of us ripe!\" Then she shook the tree until the apples fell like rain, and she shook until there were no more to fall; and when she had gathered them together in a heap, she went on farther. At last she came to a little house, and an old woman was peeping out of it, but she had such great teeth that the girl was terrified and about to run away, only the old woman called her back. \"What are you afraid of, my dear child? Come and live with me, and if you do the house-work well and orderly, things shall go well with you. You must take great pains to make my bed well, and shake it up thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about, and then in the world it snows, for I am Mother Hulda.\" As the old woman spoke so kindly, the girl took courage, consented, and went to her work. She did everything to the old woman\'s satisfaction, and shook the bed with such a will that the feathers flew about like snow-flakes: and so she led a good life, had never a cross word, but boiled and roast meat every day. When she had lived a long time with Mother Hulda, she began to feel sad, not knowing herself what ailed her; at last she began to think she must be home-sick; and although she was a thousand times better off than at home where she was, yet she had a great longing to go home. At last she said to her mistress: \"I am homesick, and although I am very well off here, I cannot stay any longer; I must go back to my own home.\" Mother Hulda answered: \"It pleases me well that you should wish to go home, and, as you have served me faithfully, I will undertake to send you there!\" She took her by the hand and led her to a large door standing open, and as she was passing through it there fell upon her a heavy shower of gold, and the gold hung all about her, so that she was covered with it. \"All this is yours, because you have been so industrious,\" said Mother Hulda; and, besides that, she returned to her her spindle, the very same that she had dropped in the well. And then the door was shut again, and the girl found herself back again in the world, not far from her mother\'s house; and as she passed through the yard the cock stood on the top of the well and cried:\n\"Cock-a-doodle doo!\nOur golden girl has come home too!\"\nThen she went in to her mother, and as she had returned covered with gold she was well received.\n\nSo the girl related all her history, and what had happened to her, and when the mother heard how she came to have such great riches she began to wish that her ugly and idle daughter might have the same good fortune. So she sent her to sit by the well and spin; and in order to make her spindle bloody she put her hand into the thorn hedge. Then she threw the spindle into the well, and jumped in herself. She found herself, like her sister, in the beautiful meadow, and followed the same path, and when she came to the baker\'s oven, the bread cried out: \"Oh, take me out, take me out, or I shall burn; I am quite done already!\" But the lazy-bones answered: \"I have no desire to black my hands,\" and went on farther. Soon she came to the apple-tree, who called out: \"Oh, shake me, shake me, we apples are all of us ripe!\" But she answered: \"That is all very fine; suppose one of you should fall on my head,\" and went on farther. When she came to Mother Hulda\'s house she did not feel afraid, as she knew beforehand of her great teeth, and entered into her service at once. The first day she put her hand well to the work, and was industrious, and did everything Mother Hulda bade her, because of the gold she expected; but the second day she began to be idle, and the third day still more so, so that she would not get up in the morning. Neither did she make Mother Hulda\'s bed as it ought to have been made, and did not shake it for the feathers to fly about. So that Mother Hulda soon grew tired of her, and gave her warning, at which the lazy thing was well pleased, and thought that now the shower of gold was coming; so Mother Hulda led her to the door, and as she stood in the doorway, instead of the shower of gold a great kettle full of pitch was emptied over her. \"That is the reward for your service,\" said Mother Hulda, and shut the door. So the lazy girl came home all covered with pitch, and the cock on the top of the well seeing her, cried:\n\"Cock-a-doodle doo!\nOur dirty girl has come home too!\"\nAnd the pitch remained sticking to her fast, and never, as long as she lived, could it be got off.\n\n</string>
    <string name="story375text">Once upon a time a mouse, a bird, and a sausage formed a partnership. They kept house together, and for a long time they lived in peace and prosperity, acquiring many possessions. The bird\'s task was to fly into the forest every day to fetch wood. The mouse carried water, made the fire, and set the table. The sausage did the cooking.\n\nWhoever is too well off always wants to try something different! Thus one day the bird chanced to meet another bird, who boasted to him of his own situation. This bird criticized him for working so hard while the other two enjoyed themselves at home. For after the mouse had made the fire and carried the water, she could sit in the parlor and rest until it was time for her to set the table. The sausage had only to stay by the pot watching the food cook. When mealtime approached, she would slither through the porridge or the vegetables, and thus everything was greased and salted and ready to eat. The bird would bring his load of wood home. They would eat their meal, and then sleep soundly until the next morning. It was a great life.\n\nThe next day, because of his friend\'s advice, the bird refused to go to the forest, saying that he had been their servant long enough. He was no longer going to be a fool for them. Everyone should try a different task for a change. The mouse and the sausage argued against this, but the bird was the master, and he insisted that they give it a try. The sausage was to fetch wood, the mouse became the cook, and the bird was to carry water.\n\nAnd what was the result? The sausage trudged off toward the forest; the bird made the fire; and the mouse put on the pot and waited for the sausage to return with wood for the next day. However, the sausage stayed out so long that the other two feared that something bad had happened. The bird flew off to see if he could find her. A short distance away he came upon a dog that had seized the sausage as free booty and was making off with her. The bird complained bitterly to the dog about this brazen abduction, but he claimed that he had discovered forged letters on the sausage, and that she would thus have to forfeit her life to him.\n\nFilled with sorrow, the bird carried the wood home himself and told the mouse what he had seen and heard. They were very sad, but were determined to stay together and make the best of it. The bird set the table while the mouse prepared the food. She jumped into the pot, as the sausage had always done, in order to slither and weave in and about the vegetables and grease them, but before she reached the middle, her hair and skin were scalded off, and she perished.\n\nWhen the bird wanted to eat, no cook was there. Beside himself, he threw the wood this way and that, called out, looked everywhere, but no cook was to be found. Because of his carelessness, the scattered wood caught fire, and the entire house was soon aflame. The bird rushed to fetch water, but the bucket fell into the well, carrying him with it, and he drowned.</string>
    <string name="story376text">A merchant had done good business at the fair; he had sold his wares, and lined his money-bags with gold and silver. Then he wanted to travel homewards, and be in his own house before nightfall. So he packed his trunk with the money on his horse, and rode away.\nAt noon he rested in a town, and when he wanted to go farther the stable-boy brought out his horse and said, \"A nail is wanting, sir, in the shoe of its left hind foot.\" - \"Let it be wanting,\" answered the merchant; \"the shoe will certainly stay on for the six miles I have still to go. I am in a hurry.\"\n\nIn the afternoon, when he once more alighted and had his horse fed, the stable-boy went into the room to him and said, \"Sir, a shoe is missing from your horse\'s left hind foot. Shall I take him to the blacksmith?\" - \"Let it still be wanting,\" answered the man; \"the horse can very well hold out for the couple of miles which remain. I am in haste.\"\n\nHe rode forth, but before long the horse began to limp. It had not limped long before it began to stumble, and it had not stumbled long before it fell down and broke its leg. The merchant was forced to leave the horse where it was, and unbuckle the trunk, take it on his back, and go home on foot. And there he did not arrive until quite late at night. \"And that unlucky nail,\" said he to himself, \"has caused all this disaster.\"\n\nHasten slowly.</string>
    <string name="story377text">Once upon a time there was a nightingale and a blindworm, each with one eye. For a long time they lived together peacefully and harmoniously in a house. However, one day the nightingale was invited to a wedding, and she said to the blindworm: \"I\'ve been invited to a wedding and don\'t particularly want to go with one eye. Would you be so kind as to lend me yours? I\'ll bring it back to you tomorrow.\"\n\nThe blindworm gave her the eye out of the kindness of her heart. But when the nightingale came home the following day, she liked having two eyes in her head and being able to see on both sides. So she refused to return the borrowed eye to the blindworm. Then the blindworm swore that she would revenge herself on the nightingale\'s children and the children of her children. \"Well,\" replied the nightingale, \"see if you can find me.\n\nI\'ll build my nest in the linden,\nso high, so high, so high.\nYou\'ll never be able to find it,\nno matter how hard you try.\"\n\nSince that time all nightingales have had two eyes, and all the blindworms, none. But wherever the nighingale builds her nest, a blindworm lives beneath it in the bushes and constantly endeavours to crawl up the tree, pierce the eggs of her enemy, and drink them up.</string>
    <string name="story378text">There was once upon a time a miller who lived with his wife in great contentment. They had money and land, and their prosperity increased year by year more and more. But ill-luck comes like a thief in the night, as their wealth had increased so did it again decrease, year by year, and at last the miller could hardly call the mill in which he lived, his own. He was in great distress, and when he lay down after his day\'s work, found no rest, but tossed about in his bed, full of care. One morning he rose before daybreak and went out into the open air, thinking that perhaps there his heart might become lighter. As he was stepping over the mill-dam the first sunbeam was just breaking forth, and he heard a rippling sound in the pond. He turned round and perceived a beautiful woman, rising slowly out of the water. Her long hair, which she was holding off her shoulders with her soft hands, fell down on both sides, and covered her white body. He soon saw that she was the Nix of the Mill-pond, and in his fright did not know whether he should run away or stay where he was. But the nix made her sweet voice heard, called him by his name, and asked him why he was so sad? The miller was at first struck dumb, but when he heard her speak so kindly, he took heart, and told her how he had formerly lived in wealth and happiness, but that now he was so poor that he did not know what to do. \"Be easy,\" answered the nix, \"I will make thee richer and happier than thou hast ever been before, only thou must promise to give me the young thing which has just been born in thy house.\" - \"What else can that be,\" thought the miller, \"but a young puppy or kitten?\" and he promised her what she desired. The nix descended into the water again, and he hurried back to his mill, consoled and in good spirits. He had not yet reached it, when the maid-servant came out of the house, and cried to him to rejoice, for his wife had given birth to a little boy. The miller stood as if struck by lightning; he saw very well that the cunning nix had been aware of it, and had cheated him. Hanging his head, he went up to his wife\'s bedside and when she said, \"Why dost thou not rejoice over the fine boy?\" he told her what had befallen him, and what kind of a promise he had given to the nix. \"Of what use to me are riches and prosperity?\" he added, \"if I am to lose my child; but what can I do?\" Even the relations, who had come thither to wish them joy, did not know what to say. In the meantime prosperity again returned to the miller\'s house. All that he undertook succeeded, it was as if presses and coffers filled themselves of their own accord, and as if money multiplied nightly in the cupboards. It was not long before his wealth was greater than it had ever been before. But he could not rejoice over it untroubled, for the bargain which he had made with the nix tormented his soul. Whenever he passed the mill-pond, he feared she might ascend and remind him of his debt. He never let the boy himself go near the water. \"Beware,\" he said to him, \"if thou dost but touch the water, a hand will rise, seize thee, and draw thee down.\" But as year after year went by and the nix did not show herself again, the miller began to feel at ease. The boy grew up to be a youth and was apprenticed to a huntsman. When he had learnt everything, and had become an excellent huntsman, the lord of the village took him into his service. In the village lived a beautiful and true-hearted maiden, who pleased the huntsman, and when his master perceived that, he gave him a little house, the two were married, lived peacefully and happily, and loved each other with all their hearts.\nOne day the huntsman was chasing a roe; and when the animal turned aside from the forest into the open country, he pursued it and at last shot it. He did not notice that he was now in the neighbourhood of the dangerous mill-pond, and went, after he had disembowelled the stag, to the water, in order to wash his blood-stained hands. Scarcely, however, had he dipped them in than the nix ascended, smilingly wound her dripping arms around him, and drew him quickly down under the waves, which closed over him. When it was evening, and the huntsman did not return home, his wife became alarmed. She went out to seek him, and as he had often told her that he had to be on his guard against the snares of the nix, and dared not venture into the neighbourhood of the mill-pond, she already suspected what had happened. She hastened to the water, and when she found his hunting-pouch lying on the shore, she could no longer have any doubt of the misfortune. Lamenting her sorrow, and wringing her hands, she called on her beloved by name, but in vain. She hurried across to the other side of the pond, and called him anew; she reviled the nix with harsh words, but no answer followed. The surface of the water remained calm, only the crescent moon stared steadily back at her. The poor woman did not leave the pond. With hasty steps, she paced round and round it, without resting a moment, sometimes in silence, sometimes uttering a loud cry, sometimes softly sobbing. At last her strength came to an end, she sank down to the ground and fell into a heavy sleep. Presently a dream took possession of her. She was anxiously climbing upwards between great masses of rock; thorns and briars caught her feet, the rain beat in her face, and the wind tossed her long hair about. When she had reached the summit, quite a different sight presented itself to her; the sky was blue, the air soft, the ground sloped gently downwards, and on a green meadow, gay with flowers of every colour, stood a pretty cottage. She went up to it and opened the door; there sat an old woman with white hair, who beckoned to her kindly. At that very moment, the poor woman awoke, day had already dawned, and she at once resolved to act in accordance with her dream. She laboriously climbed the mountain; everything was exactly as she had seen it in the night. The old woman received her kindly, and pointed out a chair on which she might sit. \"Thou must have met with a misfortune,\" she said, \"since thou hast sought out my lonely cottage.\" With tears, the woman related what had befallen her. \"Be comforted,\" said the old woman, \"I will help thee. Here is a golden comb for thee. Tarry till the full moon has risen, then go to the mill-pond, seat thyself on the shore, and comb thy long black hair with this comb. When thou hast done, lay it down on the bank, and thou wilt see what will happen.\" The woman returned home, but the time till the full moon came, passed slowly. At last the shining disc appeared in the heavens, then she went out to the mill-pond, sat down and combed her long black hair with the golden comb, and when she had finished, she laid it down at the water\'s edge. It was not long before there was a movement in the depths, a wave rose, rolled to the shore, and bore the comb away with it. In not more than the time necessary for the comb to sink to the bottom, the surface of the water parted, and the head of the huntsman arose. He did not speak, but looked at his wife with sorrowful glances. At the same instant, a second wave came rushing up, and covered the man\'s head. All had vanished, the mill-pond lay peaceful as before, and nothing but the face of the full moon shone on it. Full of sorrow, the woman went back, but again the dream showed her the cottage of the old woman. Next morning she again set out and complained of her woes to the wise woman. The old woman gave her a golden flute, and said, \"Tarry till the full moon comes again, then take this flute; play a beautiful air on it, and when thou hast finished, lay it on the sand; then thou wilt see what will happen.\" The wife did as the old woman told her. No sooner was the flute lying on the sand than there was a stirring in the depths, and a wave rushed up and bore the flute away with it. Immediately afterwards the water parted, and not only the head of the man, but half of his body also arose. He stretched out his arms longingly towards her, but a second wave came up, covered him, and drew him down again. \"Alas, what does it profit me?\" said the unhappy woman, \"that I should see my beloved, only to lose him again!\" Despair filled her heart anew, but the dream led her a third time to the house of the old woman. She set out, and the wise woman gave her a golden spinning-wheel, consoled her and said, \"All is not yet fulfilled, tarry until the time of the full moon, then take the spinning-wheel, seat thyself on the shore, and spin the spool full, and when thou hast done that, place the spinning-wheel near the water, and thou wilt see what will happen.\" The woman obeyed all she said exactly; as soon as the full moon showed itself, she carried the golden spinning-wheel to the shore, and span industriously until the flax came to an end, and the spool was quite filled with the threads. No sooner was the wheel standing on the shore than there was a more violent movement than before in the depths of the pond, and a mighty wave rushed up, and bore the wheel away with it. Immediately the head and the whole body of the man rose into the air, in a water-spout. He quickly sprang to the shore, caught his wife by the hand and fled. But they had scarcely gone a very little distance, when the whole pond rose with a frightful roar, and streamed out over the open country. The fugitives already saw death before their eyes, when the woman in her terror implored the help of the old woman, and in an instant they were transformed, she into a toad, he into a frog. The flood which had overtaken them could not destroy them, but it tore them apart and carried them far away. When the water had dispersed and they both touched dry land again, they regained their human form, but neither knew where the other was; they found themselves among strange people, who did not know their native land. High mountains and deep valleys lay between them. In order to keep themselves alive, they were both obliged to tend sheep. For many long years they drove their flocks through field and forest and were full of sorrow and longing. When spring had once more broken forth on the earth, they both went out one day with their flocks, and as chance would have it, they drew near each other. They met in a valley, but did not recognize each other; yet they rejoiced that they were no longer so lonely. Henceforth they each day drove their flocks to the same place; they did not speak much, but they felt comforted. One evening when the full moon was shining in the sky, and the sheep were already at rest, the shepherd pulled the flute out of his pocket, and played on it a beautiful but sorrowful air. When he had finished he saw that the shepherdess was weeping bitterly. \"Why art thou weeping?\" he asked. \"Alas,\" answered she, \"thus shone the full moon when I played this air on the flute for the last time, and the head of my beloved rose out of the water.\" He looked at her, and it seemed as if a veil fell from his eyes, and he recognized his dear wife, and when she looked at him, and the moon shone in his face she knew him also. They embraced and kissed each other, and no one need ask if they were happy.</string>
    <string name="story379text">There was once on a time a maiden who was pretty, but idle and negligent. When she had to spin she was so out of temper that if there was a little knot in the flax, she at once pulled out a whole heap of it, and strewed it about on the ground beside her. Now she had a servant who was industrious, and gathered together the bits of flax which were thrown away, cleaned them, span them fine, and had a beautiful gown made out of them for herself. A young man had wooed the lazy girl, and the wedding was to take place. On the eve of the wedding, the industrious one was dancing merrily about in her pretty dress, and the bride said,-\n\"Ah, how that girl does jump about, dressed in my odds and ends.\"\n\nThe bridegroom heard that, and asked the bride what she meant by it? Then she told him that the girl was wearing a dress make of the flax which she had thrown away. When the bridegroom heard that, and saw how idle she was, and how industrious the poor girl was, he gave her up and went to the other, and chose her as his wife.</string>
    <string name="story380text">Once upon a time lived a peasant and his wife, and the parson of the village had a fancy for the wife, and had wished for a long while to spend a whole day happily with her. The peasant woman, too, was quite willing. One day, therefore, he said to the woman, \"Listen, my dear friend, I have now thought of a way by which we can for once spend a whole day happily together. I\'ll tell you what; on Wednesday, you must take to your bed, and tell your husband you are ill, and if you only complain and act being ill properly, and go on doing so until Sunday when I have to preach, I will then say in my sermon that whosoever has at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick brother or whosoever else it may be, and makes a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where you can get a peck of laurel-leaves for a kreuzer, the sick child, the sick husband, the sick wife, the sick father, or sick mother, the sick sister, or whosoever else it may be, will be restored to health immediately.\"\n\"I will manage it,\" said the woman promptly. Now therefore on the Wednesday, the peasant woman took to her bed, and complained and lamented as agreed on, and her husband did everything for her that he could think of, but nothing did her any good, and when Sunday came the woman said, \"I feel as ill as if I were going to die at once, but there is one thing I should like to do before my end I should like to hear the parson\'s sermon that he is going to preach to-day.\" On that the peasant said, \"Ah, my child, do not do it — thou mightest make thyself worse if thou wert to get up. Look, I will go to the sermon, and will attend to it very carefully, and will tell thee everything the parson says.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the woman, \"go, then, and pay great attention, and repeat to me all that thou hearest.\" So the peasant went to the sermon, and the parson began to preach and said, if any one had at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or any one else, and would make a pilgimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or whosoever else it might be, would be restored to health instantly, and whosoever wished to undertake the journey was to go to him after the service was over, and he would give him the sack for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer.\n\nThen no one was more rejoiced than the peasant, and after the service was over, he went at once to the parson, who gave him the bag for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer. After that he went home, and even at the house door he cried, \"Hurrah! dear wife, it is now almost the same thing as if thou wert well! The parson has preached to-day that whosoever had at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or whoever it might be, and would make a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or whosoever else it was, would be cured immediately, and now I have already got the bag and the kreuzer from the parson, and will at once begin my journey so that thou mayst get well the faster,\" and thereupon he went away. He was, however, hardly gone before the woman got up, and the parson was there directly.\n\nBut now we will leave these two for a while, and follow the peasant, who walked on quickly without stopping, in order to get the sooner to the Göckerli hill, and on his way he met his gossip. His gossip was an egg-merchant, and was just coming from the market, where he had sold his eggs. \"May you be blessed,\" said the gossip, \"where are you off to so fast?\"\n\n\"To all eternity, my friend,\" said the peasant, \"my wife is ill, and I have been to-day to hear the parson\'s sermon, and he preached that if any one had in his house a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or any one else, and made a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, the sick husband, the sick wife, the sick father, the sick mother, the sick sister, brother or whosoever else it was, would be cured immediately, and so I have got the bag for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer from the parson, and now I am beginning my pilgrimage.\" - \"But listen, gossip,\" said the egg-merchant to the peasant, \"are you, then, stupid enough to believe such a thing as that? Don\'t you know what it means? The parson wants to spend a whole day alone with your wife in peace, so he has given you this job to do to get you out of the way.\"\n\n\"My word!\" said the peasant. \"How I\'d like to know if that\'s true!\"\n\n\"Come, then,\" said the gossip, \"I\'ll tell you what to do. Get into my egg-basket and I will carry you home, and then you will see for yourself.\" So that was settled, and the gossip put the peasant into his egg-basket and carried him home.\n\nWhen they got to the house, hurrah! but all was going merry there! The woman had already had nearly everything killed that was in the farmyard, and had made pancakes, and the parson was there, and had brought his fiddle with him. The gossip knocked at the door, and woman asked who was there. \"It is I, gossip,\" said the egg-merchant, \"give me shelter this night; I have not sold my eggs at the market, so now I have to carry them home again, and they are so heavy that I shall never be able to do it, for it is dark already.\"\n\n\"Indeed, my friend,\" said the woman, \"thou comest at a very inconvenient time for me, but as thou art here it can\'t be helped, come in, and take a seat there on the bench by the stove.\" Then she placed the gossip and the basket which he carried on his back on the bench by the stove. The parso, however, and the woman, were as merry as possible. At length the parson said, \"Listen, my dear friend, thou canst sing beautifully; sing something to me.\" - \"Oh,\" said the woman, \"I cannot sing now, in my young days indeed I could sing well enough, but that\'s all over now.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said the parson once more, \"do sing some little song.\"\n\nOn that the woman began and sang,\n\n\"I\'ve sent my husband away from me\nTo the Göckerli hill in Italy.\"\nThereupon the parson sang,\n\"I wish \'twas a year before he came back,\nI\'d never ask him for the laurel-leaf sack.\"\nHallelujah.\nThen the gossip who was in the background began to sing (but I ought to tell you the peasant was called Hildebrand), so the gossip sang,\n\"What art thou doing, my Hildebrand dear,\nThere on the bench by the stove so near?\"\n\nHallelujah.\nAnd then the peasant sang from his basket,\n\"All singing I ever shall hate from this day,\nAnd here in this basket no longer I\'ll stay.\"\nHallelujah.\nAnd he got out of the basket, and cudgelled the parson out of the house.</string>
    <string name="story381text">There was once on a time a King who had a daughter, and he caused a glass mountain to be made, and said that whosoever could cross to the other side of it without falling should have his daughter to wife. Then there was one who loved the King\'s daughter, and he asked the King if he might have her. \"Yes,\" said the King; \"if you can cross the mountain without falling, you shall have her.\" And the princess said she would go over it with him, and would hold him if he were about to fall. So they set out together to go over it, and when they were half way up the princess slipped and fell, and the glass-mountain opened and shut her up inside it, and her betrothed could not see where she had gone, for the mountain closed immediately. Then he wept and lamented much, and the King was miserable too, and had the mountain broken open where she had been lost, and though the would be able to get her out again, but they could not find the place into which she had fallen. Meanwhile the King\'s daughter had fallen quite deep down into the earth into a great cave. An old fellow with a very long gray beard came to meet her, and told her that if she would be his servant and do everything he bade her, she might live, if not he would kill her. So she did all he bade her. In the mornings he took his ladder out of his pocket, and set it up against the mountain and climbed to the top by its help, and then he drew up the ladder after him. The princess had to cook his dinner, make his bed, and do all his work, and when he came home again he always brought with him a heap of gold and silver. When she had lived with him for many years, and had grown quite old, he called her Mother Mansrot, and she had to call him Old Rinkrank. Then once when he was out, and she had made his bed and washed his dishes, she shut the doors and windows all fast, and there was one little window through which the light shone in, and this she left open. When Old Rinkrank came home, he knocked at his door, and cried, \"Mother Mansrot, open the door for me.\" - \"No,\" said she, \"Old Rinkrank, I will not open the door for thee.\" Then he said,\n\n\"Here stand I, poor Rinkrank,\nOn my seventeen long shanks,\nOn my weary, worn-out foot,\nWash my dishes, Mother Mansrot.\"\n\n\"I have washed thy dishes already,\" said she. Then again he said,\n\n\"Here stand I, poor Rinkrank,\nOn my seventeen long shanks,\nOn my weary, worn-out foot,\nMake me my bed, Mother Mansrot.\"\n\"I have made thy bed already,\" said she. Then again he said,\n\n\"Here stand I, poor Rinkrank,\nOn my seventeen long shanks,\nOn my weary, worn-out foot,\nOpen the door, Mother Mansrot.\"\n\nThen he ran all round his house, and saw that the little window was open, and thought, \"I will look in and see what she can be about, and why she will not open the door for me.\" He tried to peep in, but could not get his head through because of his long beard. So he first put his beard through the open window, but just as he had got it through, Mother Mansrot came by and pulled the window down with a cord which she had tied to it, and his beard was shut fast in it. Then he began to cry most piteously, for it hurt him very much, and to entreat her to release him again. But she said not until he gave her the ladder with which he ascended the mountain. Then, whether he would or not, he had to tell her where the ladder was. And she fastened a very long ribbon to the window, and then she set up the ladder, and ascended the mountain, and when she was at the top of it she opened the window. She went to her father, and told him all that had happened to her. The King rejoiced greatly, and her betrothed was still there, and they went and dug up the mountain, and found Old Rinkrank inside it with all his gold and silver. Then the King had Old Rinkrank put to death, and took all his gold and silver. The princess married her betrothed, and lived right happily in great magnificence and joy.</string>
    <string name="story382text">A farmer once had a faithful dog called Sultan, who had grown old, and lost all his teeth, so that he could no longer hold anything fast. One day the farmer was standing with his wife before the house-door, and said, \"To-morrow I intend to shoot Old Sultan, he is no longer of any use.\"\nHis wife, who felt pity for the faithful beast, answered, \"He has served us so long, and been so faithful, that we might well give him his keep.\"\n\n\"Eh! what?\" said the man. \"You are not very sharp. He has not a tooth left in his mouth, and not a thief is afraid of him; now he may be off. If he has served us, he has had good feeding for it.\"\n\nThe poor dog, who was lying stretched out in the sun not far off, had heard everything, and was sorry that the morrow was to be his last day. He had a good friend, the wolf, and he crept out in the evening into the forest to him, and complained of the fate that awaited him. \"Hark ye, gossip,\" said the wolf, \"be of good cheer, I will help you out of your trouble. I have thought of something. To-morrow, early in the morning, your master is going with his wife to make hay, and they will take their little child with them, for no one will be left behind in the house. They are wont, during work-time, to lay the child under the hedge in the shade; you lay yourself there too, just as if you wished to guard it. Then I will come out of the wood, and carry off the child. You must rush swiftly after me, as if you would seize it again from me. I will let it fall, and you will take it back to its parents, who will think that you have saved it, and will be far too grateful to do you any harm; on the contrary, you will be in high favor, and they will never let you want for anything again.\"\n\nThe plan pleased the dog, and it was carried out just as it was arranged. The father screamed when he saw the Wolf running across the field with his child, but when Old Sultan brought it back, then he was full of joy, and stroked him and said, \"Not a hair of yours shall be hurt, you shall eat my bread free as long as you live.\" And to his wife he said, \"Go home at once and make Old Sultan some bread-sop that he will not have to bite, and bring the pillow out of my bed, I will give him that to lie upon.\"\n\nHenceforth Old Sultan was as well off as he could wish to be.\n\nSoon afterwards the wolf visited him, and was pleased that everything had succeeded so well. \"But, gossip,\" said he, \"you will just wink an eye if when I have a chance, I carry off one of your master\'s fat sheep.\" - \"Do not reckon upon that,\" answered the dog; \"I will remain true to my master; I cannot agree to that.\" The wolf, who thought that this could not be spoken in earnest, came creeping about in the night and was going to take away the sheep. But the farmer, to whom the faithful Sultan had told the wolf\'s plan, caught him and dressed his hide soundly with the flail. The wolf had to pack off, but he cried out to the dog, \"Wait a bit, you scoundrel, you shall pay for this.\"\n\nThe next morning the wolf sent the boar to challenge the dog to come out into the forest so that they might settle the affair. Old Sultan could find no one to stand by him but a cat with only three legs, and as they went out together the poor cat limped along, and at the same time stretched out her tail into the air with pain.\n\nThe wolf and his friend were already on the spot appointed, but when they saw their enemy coming they thought that he was bringing a sabre with him, for they mistook the outstretched tail of the cat for one. And when the poor beast hopped on its three legs, they could only think every time that it was picking up a stone to throw at them. So they were both afraid; the wild boar crept into the under-wood and the wolf jumped up a tree.\n\nThe dog and the cat, when they came up, wondered that there was no one to be seen. The wild boar, however, had not been able to hide himself altogether; and one of his ears was still to be seen. Whilst the cat was looking carefully about, the boar moved his ear; the cat, who thought it was a mouse moving there, jumped upon it and bit it hard. The boar made a fearful noise and ran away, crying out, \"The guilty one is up in the tree.\" The dog and cat looked up and saw the wolf, who was ashamed of having shown himself so timid, and made friends with the dog.</string>
    <string name="story383text">There was once an old woman, but thou hast surely seen an old woman go a-begging before now? This woman begged likewise, and when she got anything she said, \"May God reward you.\" The beggar- woman came to a door, and there by the fire a friendly rogue of a boy was standing warming himself. The boy said kindly to the poor old woman as she was standing shivering thus by the door, \"Come, old mother, and warm yourself.\" She came in, but stood too near the fire, so that her old rags began to burn, and she was not aware of it. The boy stood and saw that, but he ought to have put the flames out. Is it not true that he ought to have put them out? And if he had not any water, then should he have wept all the water in his body out of his eyes, and that would have supplied two pretty streams with which to extinguish them.</string>
    <string name="story384text">There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run out of his mouth. His son and his son\'s wife were disgusted at this, so the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove, and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said nothing and only sighed. Then they bought him a wooden bowl for a few half-pence, out of which he had to eat.\nThey were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. \"What are you doing there?\" asked the father. \"I am making a little trough,\" answered the child, \"for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.\"\n\nThe man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he did spill a little of anything.</string>
    <string name="story385text">In the time when our Lord still walked this earth, he and St. Peter stopped one evening at a smith\'s and received free quarters. Then it came to pass that a poor beggar, hardly pressed by age and infirmity, came to this house and begged alms of the smith. St. Peter had compassion on him and said, \"Lord and master, if it please thee, cure his torments that he may be able to win his own bread.\" The Lord said kindly, \"Smith, lend me thy forge, and put on some coals for me, and then I will make this ailing old man young again.\" The smith was quite willing, and St. Peter blew the bellows, and when the coal fire sparkled up large and high our Lord took the little old man, pushed him in the forge in the midst of the red-hot fire, so that he glowed like a rose-bush, and praised God with a loud voice. After that the Lord went to the quenching tub, put the glowing little man into it so that the water closed over him, and after he had carefully cooled him, gave him his blessing, when behold the little man sprang nimbly out, looking fresh, straight, healthy, and as if he were but twenty. The smith, who had watched everything closely and attentively, invited them all to supper. He, however, had an old half-blind crooked, mother-in-law who went to the youth, and with great earnestness asked if the fire had burnt him much. He answered that he had never felt more comfortable, and that he had sat in the red heat as if he had been in cool dew. The youth\'s words echoed in the ears of the old woman all night long, and early next morning, when the Lord had gone on his way again and had heartily thanked the smith, the latter thought he might make his old mother-in-law young again likewise, as he had watched everything so carefully, and it lay in the province of his trade. So he called to ask her if she, too, would like to go bounding about like a girl of eighteen. She said, \"With all my heart, as the youth has come out of it so well.\" So the smith made a great fire, and thrust the old woman into it, and she writhed about this way and that, and uttered terrible cries of murder. \"Sit still; why art thou screaming and jumping about so?\" cried he, and as he spoke he blew the bellows again until all her rags were burnt. The old woman cried without ceasing, and the smith thought to himself, \"I have not quite the right art,\" and took her out and threw her into the cooling-tub. Then she screamed so loudly that the smith\'s wife upstairs and her daughter-in-law heard, and they both ran downstairs, and saw the old woman lying in a heap in the quenching-tub, howling and screaming, with her face wrinkled and shrivelled and all out of shape. Thereupon the two, who were both with child, were so terrified that that very night two boys were born who were not made like men but apes, and they ran into the woods, and from them sprang the race of apes.</string>
    <string name="story386text">A poor servant-girl was once travelling with the family with which she was in service, through a great forest, and when they were in the midst of it, robbers came out of the thicket, and murdered all they found. All perished together except the girl, who had jumped out of the carriage in a fright, and hidden herself behind a tree. When the robbers had gone away with their booty, she came out and beheld the great disaster. Then she began to weep bitterly, and said, \"What can a poor girl like me do now? I do not know how to get out of the forest, no human being lives in it, so I must certainly starve.\" She walked about and looked for a road, but could find none. When it was evening she seated herself under a tree, gave herself into God\'s keeping, and resolved to sit waiting there and not go away, let what might happen. When, however, she had sat there for a while, a white dove came flying to her with a little golden key in its mouth. It put the little key in her hand, and said, \"Dost thou see that great tree, therein is a little lock, it opens with the tiny key, and there thou wilt find food enough, and suffer no more hunger.\" Then she went to the tree and opened it, and found milk in a little dish, and white bread to break into it, so that she could eat her fill. When she was satisfied, she said, \"It is now the time when the hens at home go to roost, I am so tired I could go to bed too.\" Then the dove flew to her again, and brought another golden key in its bill, and said, \"Open that tree there, and thou willt find a bed.\" So she opened it, and found a beautiful white bed, and she prayed God to protect her during the night, and lay down and slept. In the morning the dove came for the third time, and again brought a little key, and said, \"Open that tree there, and thou wilt find clothes.\" And when she opened it, she found garments beset with gold and with jewels, more splendid than those of any king\'s daughter. So she lived there for some time, and the dove came every day and provided her with all she needed, and it was a quiet good life.\nOnce, however, the dove came and said, \"Wilt thou do something for my sake?\" - \"With all my heart,\" said the girl. Then said the little dove, \"I will guide thee to a small house; enter it, and inside it, an old woman will be sitting by the fire and will say, \'Good-day.\' But on thy life give her no answer, let her do what she will, but pass by her on the right side; further on, there is a door, which open, and thou wilt enter into a room where a quantity of rings of all kinds are lying, amongst which are some magnificent ones with shining stones; leave them, however, where they are, and seek out a plain one, which must likewise be amongst them, and bring it here to me as quickly as thou canst.\" The girl went to the little house, and came to the door. There sat an old woman who stared when she saw her, and said, \"Good-day my child.\" The girl gave her no answer, and opened the door. \"Whither away,\" cried the old woman, and seized her by the gown, and wanted to hold her fast, saying, \"That is my house; no one can go in there if I choose not to allow it.\" But the girl was silent, got away from her, and went straight into the room. Now there lay on the table an enormous quantity of rings, which gleamed and glittered before her eyes. She turned them over and looked for the plain one, but could not find it. While she was seeking, she saw the old woman and how she was stealing away, and wanting to get off with a bird-cage which she had in her hand. So she went after her and took the cage out of her hand, and when she raised it up and looked into it, a bird was inside which had the plain ring in its bill. Then she took the ring, and ran quite joyously home with it, and thought the little white dove would come and get the ring, but it did not. Then she leant against a tree and determined to wait for the dove, and, as she thus stood, it seemed just as if the tree was soft and pliant, and was letting its branches down. And suddenly the branches twined around her, and were two arms, and when she looked round, the tree was a handsome man, who embraced and kissed her heartily, and said, \"Thou hast delivered me from the power of the old woman, who is a wicked witch. She had changed me into a tree, and every day for two hours I was a white dove, and so long as she possessed the ring I could not regain my human form.\" Then his servants and his horses, who had likewise been changed into trees, were freed from the enchantment also, and stood beside him. And he led them forth to his kingdom, for he was a King\'s son, and they married, and lived happily.</string>
    <string name="story387text">There was once a woman who had three daughters, the eldest of whom was called One-eye, because she had only one eye in the middle of her forehead, and the second, Two-eyes, because she had two eyes like other folks, and the youngest, Three-eyes, because she had three eyes; and her third eye was also in the centre of her forehead. However, as Two-eyes saw just as other human beings did, her sisters and her mother could not endure her. They said to her, \"Thou, with thy two eyes, art no better than the common people; thou dost not belong to us!\" They pushed her about, and threw old clothes to her, and gave her nothing to eat but what they left, and did everything that they could to make her unhappy. It came to pass that Two-eyes had to go out into the fields and tend the goat, but she was still quite hungry, because her sisters had given her so little to eat. So she sat down on a ridge and began to weep, and so bitterly that two streams ran down from her eyes. And once when she looked up in her grief, a woman was standing beside her, who said, \"Why art thou weeping, little Two-eyes?\" Two-Eyes answered, \"Have I not reason to weep, when I have two eyes like other people, and my sisters and mother hate me for it, and push me from one corner to another, throw old clothes at me, and give me nothing to eat but the scraps they leave? To-day they have given me so little that I am still quite hungry.\" Then the wise woman said, \"Wipe away thy tears, Two-eyes, and I will tell thee something to stop thee ever suffering from hunger again; just say to thy goat,\n\n\"Bleat, my little goat, bleat,\nCover the table with something to eat,\"\n\nand then a clean well-spread little table will stand before thee, with the most delicious food upon it of which thou mayst eat as much as thou art inclined for, and when thou hast had enough, and hast no more need of the little table, just say,\n\n\"Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,\nAnd take the table quite away,\"\n\nand then it will vanish again from thy sight.\" Hereupon the wise woman departed. But Two-eyes thought, \"I must instantly make a trial, and see if what she said is true, for I am far too hungry,\" and she said,\n\n\"Bleat, my little goat, bleat,\nCover the table with something to eat,\"\n\nand scarcely had she spoken the words than a little table, covered with a white cloth, was standing there, and on it was a plate with a knife and fork, and a silver spoon; and the most delicious food was there also, warm and smoking as if it had just come out of the kitchen. Then Two-eyes said the shortest prayer she knew, \"Lord God, be with us always, Amen,\" and helped herself to some food, and enjoyed it. And when she was satisfied, she said, as the wise woman had taught her,\n\n\"Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,\nAnd take the table quite away,\"\n\nand immediately the little table and everything on it was gone again. \"That is a delightful way of keeping house!\" thought Two-eyes, and was quite glad and happy.\n\nIn the evening, when she went home with her goat, she found a small earthenware dish with some food, which her sisters had set ready for her, but she did not touch it. Next day she again went out with her goat, and left the few bits of broken bread which had been handed to her, lying untouched. The first and second time that she did this, her sisters did not remark it at all, but as it happened every time, they did observe it, and said, \"There is something wrong about Two-eyes, she always leaves her food untasted, and she used to eat up everything that was given her; she must have discovered other ways of getting food.\" In order that they might learn the truth, they resolved to send One-eye with Two-eyes when she went to drive her goat to the pasture, to observe what Two-eyes did when she was there, and whether any one brought her anything to eat and drink. So when Two-eyes set out the next time, One-eye went to her and said, \"I will go with you to the pasture, and see that the goat is well taken care of, and driven where there is food.\" But Two-eyes knew what was in One-eye\'s mind, and drove the goat into high grass and said, \"Come, One-eye, we will sit down, and I will sing something to you.\" One-eye sat down and was tired with the unaccustomed walk and the heat of the sun, and Two-eyes sang constantly,\n\n\"One eye, wakest thou?\nOne eye, sleepest thou?\"\n\nuntil One-eye shut her one eye, and fell asleep, and as soon as Two-eyes saw that One-eye was fast asleep, and could discover nothing, she said,\n\n\"Bleat, my little goat, bleat,\nCover the table with something to eat,\"\n\nand seated herself at her table, and ate and drank until she was satisfied, and then she again cried,\n\n\"Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,\nAnd take the table quite away,\"\n\nand in an instant all was gone. Two-eyes now awakened One-eye, and said, \"One-eye, you want to take care of the goat, and go to sleep while you are doing it, and in the meantime the goat might run all over the world. Come, let us go home again.\" So they went home, and again Two-eyes let her little dish stand untouched, and One-eye could not tell her mother why she would not eat it, and to excuse herself said, \"I fell asleep when I was out.\"\n\nNext day the mother said to Three-eyes, \"This time thou shalt go and observe if Two-eyes eats anything when she is out, and if any one fetches her food and drink, for she must eat and drink in secret.\" So Three-eyes went to Two-eyes, and said, \"I will go with you and see if the goat is taken proper care of, and driven where there is food.\" But Two-eyes knew what was in Three-eyes\' mind, and drove the goat into high grass and said, \"We will sit down, and I will sing something to you, Three-eyes.\" Three-eyes sat down and was tired with the walk and with the heat of the sun, and Two-eyes began the same song as before, and sang,\n\n\"Three eyes, are you waking?\"\n\nbut then, instead of singing,\n\n\"Three eyes, are you sleeping?\"\n\nas she ought to have done, she thoughtlessly sang,\n\n\"Two eyes, are you sleeping?\"\n\nand sang all the time,\n\n\"Three eyes, are you waking?\nTwo eyes, are you sleeping?\"\n\nThen two of the eyes which Three-eyes had, shut and fell asleep, but the third, as it had not been named in the song, did not sleep. It is true that Three-eyes shut it, but only in her cunning, to pretend it was asleep too, but it blinked, and could see everything very well. And when Two-eyes thought that Three-eyes was fast asleep, she used her little charm,\n\n\"Bleat, my little goat, bleat,\nCover the table with something to eat,\"\n\nand ate and drank as much as her heart desired, and then ordered the table to go away again,\n\n\"Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,\nAnd take the table quite away,\"\n\nand Three-eyes had seen everything. Then Two-eyes came to her, waked her and said, \"Have you been asleep, Three-eyes? You are a good care-taker! Come, we will go home.\" And when they got home, Two-eyes again did not eat, and Three-eyes said to the mother, \"Now, I know why that high-minded thing there does not eat. When she is out, she says to the goat,\n\n\"Bleat, my little goat, bleat,\nCover the table with something to eat,\"\n\nand then a little table appears before her covered with the best of food, much better than any we have here, and when she has eaten all she wants, she says,\n\n\"Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,\nAnd take the table quite away,\"\n\nand all disappears. I watched everything closely. She put two of my eyes to sleep by using a certain form of words, but luckily the one in my forehead kept awake.\" Then the envious mother cried, \"Dost thou want to fare better than we do? The desire shall pass away,\" and she fetched a butcher\'s knife, and thrust it into the heart of the goat, which fell down dead.\n\nWhen Two-eyes saw that, she went out full of trouble, seated herself on the ridge of grass at the edge of the field, and wept bitter tears. Suddenly the wise woman once more stood by her side, and said, \"Two-eyes, why art thou weeping?\" - \"Have I not reason to weep?\" she answered. \"The goat which covered the table for me every day when I spoke your charm, has been killed by my mother, and now I shall again have to bear hunger and want.\" The wise woman said, \"Two-eyes, I will give thee a piece of good advice; ask thy sisters to give thee the entrails of the slaughtered goat, and bury them in the ground in front of the house, and thy fortune will be made.\" Then she vanished, and Two-eyes went home and said to her sisters, \"Dear sisters, do give me some part of my goat; I don\'t wish for what is good, but give me the entrails.\" Then they laughed and said, \"If that\'s all you want, you can have it.\" So Two-eyes took the entrails and buried them quietly in the evening, in front of the house-door, as the wise woman had counselled her to do.\n\nNext morning, when they all awoke, and went to the house-door, there stood a strangely magnificent tree with leaves of silver, and fruit of gold hanging among them, so that in all the wide world there was nothing more beautiful or precious. They did not know how the tree could have come there during the night, but Two-eyes saw that it had grown up out of the entrails of the goat, for it was standing on the exact spot where she had buried them. Then the mother said to One-eye, \"Climb up, my child, and gather some of the fruit of the tree for us.\" One-eye climbed up, but when she was about to get hold of one of the golden apples, the branch escaped from her hands, and that happened each time, so that she could not pluck a single apple, let her do what she might. Then said the mother, \"Three-eyes, do you climb up; you with your three eyes can look about you better than One-eye.\" One-eye slipped down, and Three-eyes climbed up. Three-eyes was not more skilful, and might search as she liked, but the golden apples always escaped her. At length the mother grew impatient, and climbed up herself, but could get hold of the fruit no better than One-eye and Three-eyes, for she always clutched empty air. Then said Two-eyes, \"I will just go up, perhaps I may succeed better.\" The sisters cried, \"You indeed, with your two eyes, what can you do?\" But Two-eyes climbed up, and the golden apples did get out of her way, but came into her hand of their own accord, so that she could pluck them one after the other, and brought a whole apronful down with her. The mother took them away from her, and instead of treating poor Two-eyes any better for this, she and One-eye and Three-eyes were only envious, because Two-eyes alone had been able to get the fruit, and they treated her still more cruelly.\n\nIt so befell that once when they were all standing together by the tree, a young knight came up. \"Quick, Two-eyes,\" cried the two sisters, \"creep under this, and don\'t disgrace us!\" and with all speed they turned an empty barrel which was standing close by the tree over poor Two-eyes, and they pushed the golden apples which she had been gathering, under it too. When the knight came nearer he was a handsome lord, who stopped and admired the magnificent gold and silver tree, and said to the two sisters, \"To whom does this fine tree belong? Any one who would bestow one branch of it on me might in return for it ask whatsoever he desired.\" Then One-eye and Three-eyes replied that the tree belonged to them, and that they would give him a branch. They both took great trouble, but they were not able to do it, for the branches and fruit both moved away from them every time. Then said the knight, \"It is very strange that the tree should belong to you, and that you should still not be able to break a piece off.\" They again asserted that the tree was their property. Whilst they were saying so, Two-eyes rolled out a couple of golden apples from under the barrel to the feet of the knight, for she was vexed with One-eye and Three-eyes, for not speaking the truth. When the knight saw the apples he was astonished, and asked where they came from. One-eye and Three-eyes answered that they had another sister, who was not allowed to show herself, for she had only two eyes like any common person. The knight, however, desired to see her, and cried, \"Two-eyes, come forth.\" Then Two-eyes, quite comforted, came from beneath the barrel, and the knight was surprised at her great beauty, and said, \"Thou, Two-eyes, canst certainly break off a branch from the tree for me.\" - \"Yes,\" replied Two-eyes, \"that I certainly shall be able to do, for the tree belongs to me.\" And she climbed up, and with the greatest ease broke off a branch with beautiful silver leaves and golden fruit, and gave it to the knight. Then said the knight, \"Two-eyes, what shall I give thee for it?\" - \"Alas!\" answered Two-eyes, \"I suffer from hunger and thirst, grief and want, from early morning till late night; if you would take me with you, and deliver me from these things, I should be happy.\" So the knight lifted Two-eyes on to his horse, and took her home with him to his father\'s castle, and there he gave her beautiful clothes, and meat and drink to her heart\'s content, and as he loved her so much he married her, and the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicing. When Two-eyes was thus carried away by the handsome knight, her two sisters grudged her good fortune in downright earnest. The wonderful tree, however, still remains with us,\" thought they, \"and even if we can gather no fruit from it, still every one will stand still and look at it, and come to us and admire it. Who knows what good things may be in store for us?\" But next morning, the tree had vanished, and all their hopes were at an end. And when Two-eyes looked out of the window of her own little room, to her great delight it was standing in front of it, and so it had followed her.\n\nTwo-eyes lived a long time in happiness. Once two poor women came to her in her castle, and begged for alms. She looked in their faces, and recognized her sisters, One-eye, and Three-eyes, who had fallen into such poverty that they had to wander about and beg their bread from door to door. Two-eyes, however, made them welcome, and was kind to them, and took care of them, so that they both with all their hearts repented the evil that they had done their sister in their youth.</string>
    <string name="story388text">Hard by a great forest dwelt a wood-cutter with his wife, who had an only child, a little girl three years old. They were so poor, however, that they no longer had daily bread, and did not know how to get food for her. One morning the wood-cutter went out sorrowfully to his work in the forest, and while he was cutting wood, suddenly there stood before him a tall and beautiful woman with a crown of shining stars on her head, who said to him: \"I am the Virgin Mary, mother of the child Jesus. Thou art poor and needy, bring thy child to me, I will take her with me and be her mother, and care for her.\" The wood-cutter obeyed, brought his child, and gave her to the Virgin Mary, who took her up to heaven with her. There the child fared well, ate sugar-cakes, and drank sweet milk, and her clothes were of gold, and the little angels played with her. And when she was fourteen years of age, the Virgin Mary called her one day and said: \"Dear child, I am about to make a long journey, so take into thy keeping the keys of the thirteen doors of heaven. Twelve of these thou mayest open, and behold the glory which is within them, but the thirteenth, to which this little key belongs, is forbidden thee. Beware of opening it, or thou wilt bring misery on thyself.\" The girl promised to be obedient, and when the Virgin Mary was gone, she began to examine the dwellings of the kingdom of heaven. Each day she opened one of them, until she had made the round of the twelve. In each of them sat one of the Apostles in the midst of a great light, and she rejoiced in all the magnificence and splendour, and the little angels who always accompanied her rejoiced with her. Then the forbidden door alone remained, and she felt a great desire to know what could be hidden behind it, and said to the angels: \"I will not quite open it, and I will not go inside it, but I will unlock it so that we can just see a little through the opening.\" - \"Oh no,\" said the little angels, \"that would be a sin. The Virgin Mary has forbidden it, and it might easily cause thy unhappiness.\" Then she was silent, but the desire in her heart was not stilled, but gnawed there and tormented her, and let her have no rest. And once when the angels had all gone out, she thought: \"Now I am quite alone, and I could peep in. If I do it, no one will ever know.\" She sought out the key, and when she had got it in her hand, she put it in the lock, and when she had put it in, she turned it round as well. Then the door sprang open, and she saw there the Trinity sitting in fire and splendour. She stayed there awhile, and looked at everything in amazement; then she touched the light a little with her finger, and her finger became quite golden. Immediately a great fear fell on her. She shut the door violently, and ran away. Her terror too would not quit her, let her do what she might, and her heart beat continually and would not be still; the gold too stayed on her finger, and would not go away, let her rub it and wash it never so much.\n\nIt was not long before the Virgin Mary came back from her journey. She called the girl before her, and asked to have the keys of heaven back. When the maiden gave her the bunch, the Virgin looked into her eyes and said: \"Hast thou not opened the thirteenth door also?\" - \"No,\" she replied. Then she laid her hand on the girl\'s heart, and felt how it beat and beat, and saw right well that she had disobeyed her order and had opened the door. Then she said once again: \"Art thou certain that thou hast not done it?\" - \"Yes,\" said the girl, for the second time. Then she perceived the finger which had become golden from touching the fire of heaven, and saw well that the child had sinned, and said for the third time: \"Hast thou not done it?\" - \"No,\" said the girl for the third time. Then said the Virgin Mary: \"Thou hast not obeyed me, and besides that thou hast lied, thou art no longer worthy to be in heaven.\"\n\nThen the girl fell into a deep sleep, and when she awoke she lay on the earth below, and in the midst of a wilderness. She wanted to cry out, but she could bring forth no sound. She sprang up and wanted to run away, but whithersoever she turned herself, she was continually held back by thick hedges of thorns through which she could not break. In the desert, in which she was imprisoned, there stood an old hollow tree, and this had to be her dwelling-place. Into this she crept when night came, and here she slept. Here, too, she found a shelter from storm and rain, but it was a miserable life, and bitterly did she weep when she remembered how happy she had been in heaven, and how the angels had played with her. Roots and wild berries were her only food, and for these she sought as far as she could go. In the autumn she picked up the fallen nuts and leaves, and carried them into the hole. The nuts were her food in winter, and when snow and ice came, she crept amongst the leaves like a poor little animal that she might not freeze. Before long her clothes were all torn, and one bit of them after another fell off her. As soon, however, as the sun shone warm again, she went out and sat in front of the tree, and her long hair covered her on all sides like a mantle. Thus she sat year after year, and felt the pain and the misery of the world.\n\nOne day, when the trees were once more clothed in fresh green, the King of the country was hunting in the forest, and followed a roe, and as it had fled into the thicket which shut in this part of the forest, he got off his horse, tore the bushes asunder, and cut himself a path with his sword. When he had at last forced his way through, he saw a wonderfully beautiful maiden sitting under the tree; and she sat there and was entirely covered with her golden hair down to her very feet. He stood still and looked at her full of surprise, then he spoke to her and said: \"Who art thou? Why art thou sitting here in the wilderness?\" But she gave no answer, for she could not open her mouth. The King continued: \"Wilt thou go with me to my castle?\" Then she just nodded her head a little. The King took her in his arms, carried her to his horse, and rode home with her, and when he reached the royal castle he caused her to be dressed in beautiful garments, and gave her all things in abundance. Although she could not speak, she was still so beautiful and charming that he began to love her with all his heart, and it was not long before he married her.\n\nAfter a year or so had passed, the Queen brought a son into the world. Thereupon the Virgin Mary appeared to her in the night when she lay in her bed alone, and said: \"If thou wilt tell the truth and confess that thou didst unlock the forbidden door, I will open thy mouth and give thee back thy speech, but if thou perseverest in thy sin, and deniest obstinately, I will take thy new-born child away with me.\" Then the queen was permitted to answer, but she remained hard, and said: \"No, I did not open the forbidden door,\" and the Virgin Mary took the new-born child from her arms, and vanished with it. Next morning when the child was not to be found, it was whispered among the people that the Queen was a man-eater, and had killed her own child. She heard all this and could say nothing to the contrary, but the King would not believe it, for he loved her so much.\n\nWhen a year had gone by the Queen again bore a son, and in the night the Virgin Mary again came to her, and said: \"If thou wilt confess that thou openedst the forbidden door, I will give thee thy child back and untie thy tongue; but if you continuest in sin and deniest it, I will take away with me this new child also.\" Then the Queen again said: \"No, I did not open the forbidden door;\" and the Virgin took the child out of her arms, and away with her to heaven. Next morning, when this child also had disappeared, the people declared quite loudly that the Queen had devoured it, and the King\'s councillors demanded that she should be brought to justice. The King, however, loved her so dearly that he would not believe it, and commanded the councillors under pain of death not to say any more about it.\n\nThe following year the Queen gave birth to a beautiful little daughter, and for the third time the Virgin Mary appeared to her in the night and said: \"Follow me.\" She took the Queen by the hand and led her to heaven, and showed her there her two eldest children, who smiled at her, and were playing with the ball of the world. When the Queen rejoiced thereat, the Virgin Mary said: \"Is thy heart not yet softened? If thou wilt own that thou openedst the forbidden door, I will give thee back thy two little sons.\" But for the third time the Queen answered: \"No, I did not open the forbidden door.\" Then the Virgin let her sink down to earth once more, and took from her likewise her third child.\n\nNext morning, when the loss was reported abroad, all the people cried loudly: \"The Queen is a man-eater. She must be judged,\" and the King was no longer able to restrain his councillors. Thereupon a trial was held, and as she could not answer, and defend herself, she was condemned to be burnt alive. The wood was got together, and when she was fast bound to the stake, and the fire began to burn round about her, the hard ice of pride melted, her heart was moved by repentance, and she thought: \"If I could but confess before my death that I opened the door.\" Then her voice came back to her, and she cried out loudly: \"Yes, Mary, I did it,\" and straight-way rain fell from the sky and extinguished the flames of fire, and a light broke forth above her, and the Virgin Mary descended with the two little sons by her side, and the new-born daughter in her arms. She spoke kindly to her, and said: \"He who repents his sin and acknowledges it, is forgiven.\" Then she gave her the three children, untied her tongue, and granted her happiness for her whole life.\n</string>
    <string name="story389text">Two or three hundred years ago, when people were far from being so crafty and cunning as they are now-a-day, an extraordinary event took place in a little town. By some mischance one of the great owls, called horned owls, had come from the neighboring woods into the barn of one of the townsfolk in the night-time, and when day broke did not dare to venture forth again from her retreat, for fear of the other birds, which raised a terrible outcry whenever she appeared. In the morning when the man-servant went into the barn to fetch some straw, he was so mightily alarmed at the sight of the owl sitting there in a corner, that he ran away and announced to his master that a monster, the like of which he had never set eyes on in his life, and which could devour a man without the slightest difficulty, was sitting in the barn, rolling its eyes about in its head. \"I know you already,\" said the master, \"you have courage enough to chase a blackbird about the fields, but when you see a dead hen lying, you have to get a stick before you go near it. I must go and see for myself what kind of a monster it is,\" added the master, and went quite boldly into the granary and looked round him. When, however, he saw the strange grim creature with his own eyes, he was no less terrified than the servant had been. With two bounds he sprang out, ran to his neighbours, and begged them imploringly to lend him assistance against an unknown and dangerous beast, or else the whole town might be in danger if it were to break loose out of the barn, where it was shut up. A great noise and clamour arose in all the streets, the townsmen came armed with spears, hay-forks, scythes, and axes, as if they were going out against an enemy; finally, the senators appeared with the burgomaster at their head. When they had drawn up in the market- place, they marched to the barn, and surrounded it on all sides. Thereupon one of the most courageous of them stepped forth and entered with his spear lowered, but came running out immediately afterwards with a shriek and as pale as death, and could not utter a single word. Yet two others ventured in, but they fared no better. At last one stepped forth; a great strong man who was famous for his warlike deeds, and said, \"You will not drive away the monster by merely looking at him; we must be in earnest here, but I see that you have all tuned into women, and not one of you dares to encounter the animal.\" He ordered them to give him some armour, had a sword and spear brought, and armed himself. All praised his courage, though many feared for his life. The two barn-doors were opened, and they saw the owl, which in the meantime had perched herself on the middle of a great cross-beam. He had a ladder brought, and when he raised it, and made ready to climb up, they all cried out to him that he was to bear himself bravely, and commended him to St. George, who slew the dragon. When he had just got to the top, and the owl perceived that he had designs on her, and was also bewildered by the crowd and the shouting, and knew not how to escape, she rolled her eyes, ruffled her feathers, flapped her wings, snapped her beak, and cried, \"Tuwhit, tuwhoo,\" in a harsh voice. \"Strike home! strike home!\" screamed the crowd outside to the valiant hero. \"Any one who was standing where I am standing,\" answered he, \"would not cry, strike home!\" He certainly did plant his foot one rung higher on the ladder, but then he began to tremble, and half-fainting, went back again.\nAnd now there was no one left who dared to put himself in such danger. \"The monster,\" said they, \"has poisoned and mortally wounded the very strongest man among us, by snapping at him and just breathing on him! Are we, too, to risk our lives?\" They took counsel as to what they ought to do to prevent the whole town being destroyed. For a long time everything seemed to be of no use, but at length the burgomaster found an expedient. \"My opinion,\" said he, \"is that we ought, out of the common purse, to pay for this barn, and whatsoever corn, straw, or hay it contains, and thus indemnify the owner, and then burn down the whole building, and the terrible beast with it. Thus no one will have to endanger his life. This is no time for thinking of expense, and niggardliness would be ill applied.\" All agreed with him. So they set fire to the barn at all four corners, and with it the owl was miserably burnt. Let any one who will not believe it, go thither and inquire for himself.</string>
    <string name="story390text">The cock once said to the hen, \"It is now the time when our nuts are ripe, so let us go to the hill together and for once eat our fill before the squirrel takes them all away.\" - \"Yes,\" replied the hen, \"come, we will have some pleasure together.\" Then they went away to the hill, and on it was a bright day they stayed till evening. Now I do not know whether it was that they had eaten till they were too fat, or whether they had become proud, but they would not go home on foot, and the cock had to build a little carriage of nut-shells. When it was ready, the little hen seated herself in it and said to the cock, \"Thou canst just harness thyself to it.\" - \"I like that!\" said the cock, \"I would rather go home on foot than let myself be harnessed to it; no, that is not our bargain. I do not mind being coachman and sitting on the box, but drag it myself I will not.\"\n\nAs they were thus disputing, a duck quacked to them, \"You thieving folks, who bade you go to my nut-hill? Well, you shall suffer for it!\" and ran with open beak at the cock. But the cock also was not idle, and fell boldly on the duck, and at last wounded her so with his spurs that she also begged for mercy, and willingly let herself be harnessed to the carriage as a punishment. The little cock now seated himself on the box and was coachman, and thereupon they went off in a gallop, with \"Duck, go as fast as thou canst.\" When they had driven a part of the way they met two foot-passengers, a pin and a needle. They cried, \"Stop! stop!\" and said that it would soon be as dark as pitch, and then they could not go a step further, and that it was so dirty on the road, and asked if they could not get into the carriage for a while. They had been at the tailor\'s public- house by the gate, and had stayed too long over the beer. As they were thin people, who did not take up much room, the cock let them both get in, but they had to promise him and his little hen not to step on their feet. Late in the evening they came to an inn, and as they did not like to go further by night, and as the duck also was not strong on her feet, and fell from one side to the other, they went in. The host at first made many objections, his house was already full, besides he thought they could not be very distinguished persons; but at last, as they made pleasant speeches, and told him that he should have the egg which the little hen has laid on the way, and should likewise keep the duck, which laid one every day, he at length said that they might stay the night. And now they had themselves well served, and feasted and rioted. Early in the morning, when day was breaking, and every one was asleep, the cock awoke the hen, brought the egg, pecked it open, and they ate it together, but they threw the shell on the hearth. Then they went to the needle which was still asleep, took it by the head and stuck it into the cushion of the landlord\'s chair, and put the pin in his towel, and at the last without more ado they flew away over the heath. The duck who liked to sleep in the open air and had stayed in the yard, heard them going away, made herself merry and found a stream, down which she swam, which was a much quicker way of travelling than being harnessed to a carriage. The host did not get out of bed for two hours after this; he washed himself and wanted to dry himself, then the pin went over his face and made a red streak from one ear to the other. After this he went into the kitchen and wanted to light a pipe, but when he came to the hearth the egg-shell darted into his eyes. \"This morning everything attacks my head, \" said he, and angrily sat down on his grandfather\'s chair, but he quickly started up again and cried, \"Woe is me, \" for the needle had pricked him still worse than the pin, and not in the head. Now he was thoroughly angry, and suspected the guests who had come so late the night before, and when he went and looked about for them, they were gone. Then he made a vow to take no more ragamuffins into his house, for they consume much, pay for nothing, and play mischievous tricks into the bargain by way of gratitude.</string>
    <string name="story391text">There was once on a time a far-sighted, crafty peasant whose tricks were much talked about. The best story is, however, how he once got hold of the Devil, and made a fool of him. The peasant had one day been working in his field, and as twilight had set in, was making ready for the journey home, when he saw a heap of burning coals in the middle of his field, and when, full of astonishment, he went up to it, a little black devil was sitting on the live coals. \"Thou dost indeed sit upon a treasure!\" said the peasant. \"Yes, in truth,\" replied the Devil, \"on a treasure which contains more gold and silver than thou hast ever seen in thy life!\" - \"The treasure lies in my field and belongs to me,\" said the peasant. \"It is thine,\" answered the Devil, \"if thou wilt for two years give me the half of everything thy field produces. Money I have enough of, but I have a desire for the fruits of the earth.\" The peasant agreed to the bargain. \"In order, however, that no dispute may arise about the division,\" said he, \"everything that is above ground shall belong to thee, and what is under the earth to me.\" The Devil was quite satisfied with that, but the cunning peasant had sown turnips.\nNow when the time for harvest came, the Devil appeared and wanted to take away his crop; but he found nothing but the yellow withered leaves, while the peasant, full of delight, was digging up his turnips. \"Thou hast had the best of it for once,\" said the Devil, \"but the next time that won\'t do. What grows above ground shall be thine, and what is under it, mine.\" - \"I am willing,\" replied the peasant; but when the time came to sow, he did not again sow turnips, but wheat. The grain became ripe, and the peasant went into the field and cut the full stalks down to the ground. When the Devil came, he found nothing but the stubble, and went away in a fury down into a cleft in the rocks. \"That is the way to cheat the Devil,\" said the peasant, and went and fetched away the treasure.</string>
    <string name="story392text">Once on a time a poor pious peasant died, and arrived before the gate of heaven. At the same time a very rich, rich lord came there who also wanted to get into heaven. Then Saint Peter came with the key, and opened the door, and let the great man in, but apparently did not see the peasant, and shut the door again. And now the peasant outside, heard how the great man was received in heaven with all kinds of rejoicing, and how they were making music, and singing within. At length all became quiet again, and Saint Peter came and opened the gate of heaven, and let the peasant in. The peasant, however, expected that they would make music and sing when he went in also, but all remained quite quiet; he was received with great affection, it is true, and the angels came to meet him, but no one sang. Then the peasant asked Saint Peter how it was that they did not sing for him as they had done when the rich man went in, and said that it seemed to him that there in heaven things were done with just as much partiality as on earth.\n\nThen said Saint Peter, \"By no means, thou art just as dear to us as any one else, and wilt enjoy every heavenly delight that the rich man enjoys, but poor fellows like thee come to heaven every day, but a rich man like this does not come more than once in a hundred years!\"</string>
    <string name="story393text">There was once a poor peasant who had no land, but only a small house, and one daughter. Then said the daughter, \"We ought to ask our lord the King for a bit of newly-cleared land.\" When the King heard of their poverty, he presented them with a piece of land, which she and her father dug up, and intended to sow with a little corn and grain of that kind. When they had dug nearly the whole of the field, they found in the earth a mortar made of pure gold. \"Listen,\" said the father to the girl, \"as our lord the King has been so gracious and presented us with the field, we ought to give him this mortar in return for it.\" The daughter, however, would not consent to this, and said, \"Father, if we have the mortar without having the pestle as well, we shall have to get the pestle, so you had much better say nothing about it.\" He would, however, not obey her, but took the mortar and carried it to the King, said that he had found it in the cleared land, and asked if he would accept it as a present. The King took the mortar, and asked if he had found nothing besides that? \"No,\" answered the countryman. Then the King said that he must now bring him the pestle. The peasant said they had not found that, but he might just as well have spoken to the wind; he was put in prison, and was to stay there until he produced the pestle. The servants had daily to carry him bread and water, which is what people get in prison, and they heard how the man cried out continually, \"Ah! if I had but listened to my daughter! Alas, alas, if I had but listened to my daughter!\" and would neither eat nor drink. So he commanded the servants to bring the prisoner before him, and then the King asked the peasant why he was always crying, \"Ah! if I had but listened to my daughter!\" and what it was that his daughter had said. \"She told me that I ought not to take the mortar to you, for I should have to produce the pestle as well.\" - \"If you have a daughter who is as wise as that, let her come here.\" She was therefore obliged to appear before the King, who asked her if she really was so wise, and said he would set her a riddle, and if she could guess that, he would marry her. She at once said yes, she would guess it. Then said the King, \"Come to me not clothed, not naked, not riding, not walking, not in the road, and not out of the road, and if thou canst do that I will marry thee.\" So she went away, put off everything she had on, and then she was not clothed, and took a great fishing net, and seated herself in it and wrapped it entirely round and round her, so that she was not naked, and she hired an ass, and tied the fisherman\'s net to its tail, so that it was forced to drag her along, and that was neither riding nor walking. The ass had also to drag her in the ruts, so that she only touched the ground with her great toe, and that was neither being in the road nor out of the road. And when she arrived in that fashion, the King said she had guessed the riddle and fulfilled all the conditions. Then he ordered her father to be released from the prison, took her to wife, and gave into her care all the royal possessions.\nNow when some years had passed, the King was once drawing up his troops on parade, when it happened that some peasants who had been selling wood stopped with their waggons before the palace; some of them had oxen yoked to them, and some horses. There was one peasant who had three horses, one of which was delivered of a young foal, and it ran away and lay down between two oxen which were in front of the waggon. When the peasants came together, they began to dispute, to beat each other and make a disturbance, and the peasant with the oxen wanted to keep the foal, and said one of the oxen had given birth to it, and the other said his horse had had it, and that it was his. The quarrel came before the King, and he give the verdict that the foal should stay where it had been found, and so the peasant with the oxen, to whom it did not belong, got it. Then the other went away, and wept and lamented over his foal. Now he had heard how gracious his lady the Queen was because she herself had sprung from poor peasant folks, so he went to her and begged her to see if she could not help him to get his foal back again. Said she, \"Yes, I will tell you what to do, if thou wilt promise me not to betray me. Early to-morrow morning, when the King parades the guard, place thyself there in the middle of the road by which he must pass, take a great fishing-net and pretend to be fishing; go on fishing, too, and empty out the net as if thou hadst got it full\" and then she told him also what he was to say if he was questioned by the King. The next day, therefore, the peasant stood there, and fished on dry ground. When the King passed by, and saw that, he sent his messenger to ask what the stupid man was about? He answered, \"I am fishing.\" The messenger asked how he could fish when there was no water there? The peasant said, \"It is as easy for me to fish on dry land as it is for an ox to have a foal.\" The messenger went back and took the answer to the King, who ordered the peasant to be brought to him and told him that this was not his own idea, and he wanted to know whose it was? The peasant must confess this at once. The peasant, however, would not do so, and said always, God forbid he should! the idea was his own. They laid him, however, on a heap of straw, and beat him and tormented him so long that at last he admitted that he had got the idea from the Queen.\n\nWhen the King reached home again, he said to his wife, \"Why hast thou behaved so falsely to me? I will not have thee any longer for a wife; thy time is up, go back to the place from whence thou camest to thy peasant\'s hut.\" One favour, however, he granted her; she might take with her the one thing that was dearest and best in her eyes; and thus was she dismissed. She said, \"Yes, my dear husband, if you command this, I will do it,\" and she embraced him and kissed him, and said she would take leave of him. Then she ordered a powerful sleeping draught to be brought, to drink farewell to him; the King took a long draught, but she took only a little. He soon fell into a deep sleep, and when she perceived that, she called a servant and took a fair white linen cloth and wrapped the King in it, and the servant was forced to carry him into a carriage that stood before the door, and she drove with him to her own little house. She laid him in her own little bed, and he slept one day and one night without awakening, and when he awoke he looked round and said, \"Good God! where am I?\" He called his attendants, but none of them were there. At length his wife came to his bedside and said, \"My dear lord and King, you told me I might bring away with me from the palace that which was dearest and most precious in my eyes I have nothing more precious and dear than yourself, so I have brought you with me.\" Tears rose to the King\'s eyes and he said, \"Dear wife, thou shalt be mine and I will be thine,\" and he took her back with him to the royal palace and was married again to her, and at the present time they are very likely still living.</string>
    <string name="story394text">There was once on a time a Queen to whom God had given no children. Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to bestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her and said, \"Be at rest, thou shalt have a son with the power of wishing, so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.\" Then she went to the King, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time was come she gave birth to a son, and the King was filled with gladness. Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild beasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It happened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in her arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that the child had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen, and cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the Queen\'s apron and on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a secret place, where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the King and accused the Queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by the wild beasts. When the King saw the blood on her apron, he believed this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be seen, and had his wife put into it, and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven years without meat or drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two angels from heaven in the shape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her food until the seven years were over.\nThe cook, however, thought to himself, \"If the child has the power of wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.\" So he left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to speak, and said to him, \"Wish for a beautiful palace for thyself with a garden, and all else that pertains to it.\" Scarcely were the words out of the boy\'s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for. After a while the cook said to him, \"It is not well for thee to be so alone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.\" Then the King\'s son wished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more beautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two played together, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook went out hunting like a nobleman. The thought, however, occurred to him that the King\'s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus bring him into great peril. So he went out and took the maiden aside, and said, \"To-night when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if thou dost not do it, thou shalt lose thy life.\" Thereupon he went away, and when he returned next day she had not done it, and said, \"Why should I shed the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed any one?\" The cook once more said, \"If thou dost not do it, it shall cost thee thy own life.\" When he had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her to be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate, and when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy, \"Lie down in thy bed, and draw the clothes over thee.\" Then the wicked wretch came in and said, \"Where are the boy\'s heart and tongue?\" The girl reached the plate to him, but the King\'s son threw off the quilt, and said, \"Thou old sinner, why didst thou want to kill me? Now will I pronounce thy sentence. Thou shalt become a black poodle and have a gold collar round thy neck, and shalt eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from thy throat.\" And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed into a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks were ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the flames broke forth from his throat. The King\'s son remained there a short while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she were still alive. At length he said to the maiden, \"I will go home to my own country; if thou wilt go with me, I will provide for thee.\" - \"Ah,\" she replied, \"the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land where I am unknown?\" As she did not seem quite willing, and as they could not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed into a beautiful pink, and took her with him. Then he went away to his own country, and the poodle had to run after him. He went to the tower in which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for a ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up and looked inside, and cried, \"Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still alive, or are you dead?\" She answered, \"I have just eaten, and am still satisfied,\" for she thought the angels were there. Said he, \"I am your dear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms; but I am alive still, and will speedily deliver you.\" Then he descended again, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a strange huntsman, and asked if he could give him a place. The King said yes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to him, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the district or country. Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game for him as he could possibly use at the royal table. So he summoned all the huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him. And he went with them and made them form a great circle, open at one end where he stationed himself, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more came running inside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them. Then they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the King, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having had none at all for years.\n\nNow the King felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When they were all assembled together, he said to the huntsmen, \"As thou art so clever, thou shalt sit by me.\" He replied, \"Lord King, your majesty must excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.\" But the King insisted on it, and said, \"Thou shalt sit by me,\" until he did it. Whilst he was sitting there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the King\'s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how it was faring with the Queen in the tower, and if she were alive still, or had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began, and said, \"Your majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the Queen living in the tower? Is she still alive, or has she died?\" But the King replied, \"She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will not have her named.\" Then the huntsman arose and said, \"Gracious lord father, she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away by wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her arms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a chicken.\" Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said, \"That is the wretch!\" and caused live coals to be brought, and these the dog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst forth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the King if he would like to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form of the cook, in the which he stood immediately, with his white apron, and his knife by his side. When the King saw him he fell into a passion, and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman spoke further and said, \"Father, will you see the maiden who brought me up so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it, though her own life depended on it?\" The King replied, \"Yes, I would like to see her.\" The son said, \"Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower,\" and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the King had never seen one to equal it. Then the son said, \"Now will I show her to you in her own form,\" and wished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.\n\nAnd the King sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower, to fetch the Queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was led in she ate nothing, and said, \"The gracious and merciful God who has supported me in the tower, will speedily deliver me.\" She lived three days more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged King ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the King\'s own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden whom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they are still alive or not, is known to God.</string>
    <string name="story395text">There was once a poor shepherd-boy whose father and mother were dead, and he was placed by the authorities in the house of a rich man, who was to feed him and bring him up. The man and his wife, had however, bad hearts, and were greedy and anxious about their riches, and vexed whenever any one put a morsel of their bread in his mouth. The poor young fellow might do what he liked, he got little to eat, but only so many blows the more.\nOne day he had to watch a hen and her chickens, but she ran through a quick-set hedge with them, and a hawk darted down instantly, and carried her off through the air. The boy called, \"Thief! thief! rascal!\" with all the strength of his body. But what good did that do? The hawk did not bring its prey back again. The man heard the noise, and ran to the spot, and as soon as he saw that his hen was gone, he fell in a rage, and gave the boy such a beating that he could not stir for two days. Then he had to take care of the chickens without the hen, but now his difficulty was greater, for one ran here and the other there. He thought he was doing a very wise thing when he tied them all together with a string, because then the hawk would not be able to steal any of them away from him. But he was very much mistaken. After two days, worn out with running about and hunger, he fell asleep; the bird of prey came, and seized one of the chickens, and as the others were tied fast to it, it carried them all off together, perched itself on a tree, and devoured them. The farmer was just coming home, and when he saw the misfortune, he got angry and beat the boy so unmercifully that he was forced to lie in bed for several days.\n\nWhen he was on his legs again, the farmer said to him, \"Thou art too stupid for me, I cannot make a herdsman of thee, thou must go as errand-boy.\" Then he sent him to the judge, to whom he was to carry a basketful of grapes, and he gave him a letter as well. On the way hunger and thirst tormented the unhappy boy so violently that he ate two of the bunches of grapes. He took the basket to the judge, but when the judge had read the letter, and counted the bunches he said, \"Two clusters are wanting.\" The boy confessed quite honestly that, driven by hunger and thirst, he had devoured the two which were wanting. The judge wrote a letter to the farmer, and asked for the same number of grapes again. These also the boy had to take to him with a letter. As he again was so extremely hungry and thirsty, he could not help it, and again ate two bunches. But first he took the letter out of the basket, put it under a stone and seated himself thereon in order that the letter might not see and betray him. The judge, however, again made him give an explanation about the missing bunches. \"Ah,\" said the boy, \"how have you learnt that?\" The letter could not know about it, for I put it under a stone before I did it.\" The judge could not help laughing at the boy\'s simplicity, and sent the man a letter wherein he cautioned him to keep the poor boy better, and not let him want for meat and drink, and also that he was to teach him what was right and what was wrong.\n\n\"I will soon show thee the difference,\" said the hard man, \"if thou wilt eat, thou must work, and if thou dost anything wrong, thou shalt be quite sufficiently taught by blows.\"\n\nThe next day he set him a hard task. He was to chop two bundles of straw for food for the horses, and then the man threatened: \"In five hours,\" said he, \"I shall be back again, and if the straw is not cut to chaff by that time, I will beat thee until thou canst not move a limb.\" The farmer went with his wife, the man-servant and the girl, to the yearly fair, and left nothing behind for the boy but a small bit of bread. The boy seated himself on the bench, and began to work with all his might. As he got warm over it he put his little coat off and threw it on the straw. In his terror lest he should not get done in time he kept constantly cutting, and in his haste, without noticing it, he chopped his little coat as well as the straw. He became aware of the misfortune too late; there was no repairing it. \"Ah,\" cried he, \"now all is over with me! The wicked man did not threaten me for nothing; if he comes back and sees what I have done, he will kill me. Rather than that I will take my own life.\"\n\nThe boy had once heard the farmer\'s wife say, \"I have a pot with poison in it under my bed.\" She, however, had only said that to keep away greedy people, for there was honey in it. The boy crept under the bed, brought out the pot, and ate all that was in it. \"I do not know,\" said he, \"folks say death is bitter, but it tastes very sweet to me. It is no wonder that the farmer\'s wife has so often longed for death.\" He seated himself in a little chair, and was prepared to die. But instead of becoming weaker he felt himself strengthened by the nourishing food. \"It cannot have been poison,\" thought he, \"but the farmer once said there was a small bottle of poison for flies in the box in which he keeps his clothes; that, no doubt, will be the true poison, and bring death to me.\" It was, however, no poison for flies, but Hungarian wine. The boy got out the bottle, and emptied it. \"This death tastes sweet too,\" said he, but shortly after when the wine began to mount into his brain and stupefy him, he thought his end was drawing near. \"I feel that I must die,\" said he, \"I will go away to the churchyard, and seek a grave.\" He staggered out, reached the churchyard, and laid himself in a newly dug grave. He lost his senses more and more. In the neighbourhood was an inn where a wedding was being kept; when he heard the music, he fancied he was already in Paradise, until at length he lost all consciousness. The poor boy never awoke again; the heat of the strong wine and the cold night-dew deprived him of life, and he remained in the grave in which he had laid himself.\n\nWhen the farmer heard the news of the boy\'s death he was terrified, and afraid of being brought to justice indeed, his distress took such a powerful hold of him that he fell fainting to the ground. His wife, who was standing on the hearth with a pan of hot fat, ran to him to help him. But the flames darted against the pan, the whole house caught fire, in a few hours it lay in ashes, and the rest of the years they had to live they passed in poverty and misery, tormented by the pangs of conscience.</string>
    <string name="story396text">In olden times, when the Lord himself still used to walk about on this earth amongst men, it once happened that he was tired and overtaken by the darkness before he could reach an inn. Now there stood on the road before him two houses facing each other; the one large and beautiful, the other small and poor. The large one belonged to a rich man, and the small one to a poor man.\n\nThen the Lord thought, \"I shall be no burden to the rich man, I will stay the night with him.\" When the rich man heard some one knocking at his door, he opened the window and asked the stranger what he wanted. The Lord answered, \"I only ask for a night\'s lodging.\"\n\nThen the rich man looked at the traveler from head to foot, and as the Lord was wearing common clothes, and did not look like one who had much money in his pocket, he shook his head, and said, \"No, I cannot take you in, my rooms are full of herbs and seeds; and if I were to lodge everyone who knocked at my door, I might very soon go begging myself. Go somewhere else for a lodging,\" and with this he shut down the window and left the Lord standing there.\n\nSo the Lord turned his back on the rich man, and went across to the small house and knocked. He had hardly done so when the poor man opened the little door and bade the traveler come in. \"Pass the night with me, it is already dark,\" said he; \"you cannot go any further to-night.\" This pleased the Lord, and he went in. The poor man\'s wife shook hands with him, and welcomed him, and said he was to make himself at home and put up with what they had got; they had not much to offer him, but what they had they would give him with all their hearts. Then she put the potatoes on the fire, and while they were boiling, she milked the goat, that they might have a little milk with them. When the cloth was laid, the Lord sat down with the man and his wife, and he enjoyed their coarse food, for there were happy faces at the table. When they had had supper and it was bed-time, the woman called her husband apart and said, \"Hark you, dear husband, let us make up a bed of straw for ourselves to-night, and then the poor traveler can sleep in our bed and have a good rest, for he has been walking the whole day through, and that makes one weary.\" - \"With all my heart,\" he answered, \"I will go and offer it to him;\" and he went to the stranger and invited him, if he had no objection, to sleep in their bed and rest his limbs properly. But the Lord was unwilling to take their bed from the two old folks; however, they would not be satisfied, until at length he did it and lay down in their bed, while they themselves lay on some straw on the ground.\n\nNext morning they got up before daybreak, and made as good a breakfast as they could for the guest. When the sun shone in through the little window, and the Lord had got up, he again ate with them, and then prepared to set out on his journey.\n\nBut as he was standing at the door he turned round and said, \"As you are so kind and good, you may wish three things for yourselves and I will grant them.\" Then the man said, \"What else should I wish for but eternal happiness, and that we two, as long as we live, may be healthy and have every day our daily bread; for the third wish, I do not know what to have.\" And the Lord said to him, \"Will you wish for a new house instead of this old one?\" - \"Oh, yes,\" said the man; \"if I can have that, too, I should like it very much.\" And the Lord fulfilled his wish, and changed their old house into a new one, again gave them his blessing, and went on.\n\nThe sun was high when the rich man got up and leaned out of his window and saw, on the opposite side of the way, a new clean-looking house with red tiles and bright windows where the old hut used to be. He was very much astonished, and called his wife and said to her, \"Tell me, what can have happened? Last night there was a miserable little hut standing there, and to-day there is a beautiful new house. Run over and see how that has come to pass.\"\n\nSo his wife went and asked the poor man, and he said to her, \"Yesterday evening a traveler came here and asked for a night\'s lodging, and this morning when he took leave of us he granted us three wishes — eternal happiness, health during this life and our daily bread as well, and besides this, a beautiful new house instead of our old hut.\"\n\nWhen the rich man\'s wife heard this, she ran back in haste and told her husband how it had happened. The man said, \"I could tear myself to pieces! If I had but known that! That traveler came to our house too, and wanted to sleep here, and I sent him away.\" - \"Quick!\" said his wife, \"get on your horse. You can still catch the man up, and then you must ask to have three wishes granted to you.\"\n\nThe rich man followed the good counsel and galloped away on his horse, and soon came up with the Lord. He spoke to him softly and pleasantly, and begged him not to take it amiss that he had not let him in directly; he was looking for the front-door key, and in the meantime the stranger had gone away, if he returned the same way he must come and stay with him. \"Yes,\" said the Lord; \"if I ever come back again, I will do so.\" Then the rich man asked if might not wish for three things too, as his neighbor had done? \"Yes,\" said the Lord, he might, but it would not be to his advantage, and he had better not wish for anything; but the rich man thought that he could easily ask for something which would add to his happiness, if he only knew that it would be granted. So the Lord said to him, \"Ride home, then, and three wishes which you shall form, shall be fulfilled.\"\n\nThe rich man had now gained what he wanted, so he rode home, and began to consider what he should wish for. As he was thus thinking he let the bridle fall, and the horse began to caper about, so that he was continually disturbed in his meditations, and could not collect his thoughts at all. He patted its neck, and said, \"Gently, Lisa,\" but the horse only began new tricks. Then at last he was angry, and cried quite impatiently, \"I wish your neck was broken!\" Directly he had said the words, down the horse fell on the ground, and there it lay dead and never moved again. And thus was his first wish fulfilled. As he was miserly by nature, he did not like to leave the harness lying there; so he cut it off, and put it on his back; and now he had to go on foot. \"I have still two wishes left,\" said he, and comforted himself with that thought.\n\nAnd now as he was walking slowly through the sand, and the sun was burning hot at noon-day, he grew quite hot-tempered and angry. The saddle hurt his back, and he had not yet any idea what to wish for. \"If I were to wish for all the riches and treasures in the world,\" said he to himself, \"I should still to think of all kinds of other things later on, I know that, beforehand. But I will manage so that there is nothing at all left me to wish for afterwards.\" Then he sighed and said, \"Ah, if I were but that Bavarian peasant, who likewise had three wishes granted to him, and knew quite well what to do, and in the first place wished for a great deal of beer, and in the second for as much beer as he was able to drink, and in the third for a barrel of beer into the bargain.\"\n\nMany a time he thought he had found it, but then it seemed to him to be, after all, too little. Then it came into his mind, what an easy life his wife had, for she stayed at home in a cool room and enjoyed herself. This really did vex him, and before he was aware, he said, \"I just wish she was sitting there on this saddle, and could not get off it, instead of my having to drag it along on my back.\" And as the last word was spoken, the saddle disappeared from his back, and he saw that his second wish had been fulfilled. Then he really did feel warm. He began to run and wanted to be quite alone in his own room at home, to think of something really large for his last wish. But when he arrived there and opened the parlour-door, he saw his wife sitting in the middle of the room on the saddle, crying and complaining, and quite unable to get off it. So he said, \"Do bear it, and I will wish for all the riches on earth for thee, only stay where thou art.\" She, however, called him a fool, and said, \"What good will all the riches on earth do me, if I am to sit on this saddle? Thou hast wished me on it, so thou must help me off.\" So whether he would or not, he was forced to let his third wish be that she should be quit of the saddle, and able to get off it, and immediately the wish was fulfilled. So he got nothing by it but vexation, trouble, abuse, and the loss of his horse; but the poor people lived happily, quietly, and piously until their happy death.</string>
    <string name="story397text">In a certain mill lived an old miller who had neither wife nor child, and three apprentices served under him. As they had been with him several years, he one day said to them, \"I am old, and want to sit in the chimney-corner, go out, and whichsoever of you brings me the best horse home, to him will I give the mill, and in return for it he shall take care of me till my death.\" The third of the boys was, however, the drudge, who was looked on as foolish by the others; they begrudged the mill to him, and afterwards he would not have it. Then all three went out together, and when they came to the village, the two said to stupid Hans, \"Thou mayst just as well stay here, as long as thou livest thou wilt never get a horse.\" Hans, however, went with them, and when it was night they came to a cave in which they lay down to sleep. The two sharp ones waited until Hans had fallen asleep, then they got up, and went away leaving him where he was. And they thought they had done a very clever thing, but it was certain to turn out ill for them. When the sun arose, and Hans woke up, he was lying in a deep cavern. He looked around on every side and exclaimed, \"Oh, heavens, where am I?\" Then he got up and clambered out of the cave, went into the forest, and thought, \"Here I am quite alone and deserted, how shall I obtain a horse now?\" Whilst he was thus walking full of thought, he met a small tabby-cat which said quite kindly, \"Hans, where are you going?\" - \"Alas, thou canst not help me.\" - \"I well know your desire,\" said the cat. \"You wish to have a beautiful horse. Come with me, and be my faithful servant for seven years long, and then I will give you one more beautiful than any you have ever seen in your whole life.\" - \"Well, this is a wonderful cat!\" thought Hans, \"but I am determined to see if she is telling the truth.\" So she took him with her into her enchanted castle, where there were nothing but cats who were her servants. They leapt nimbly upstairs and downstairs, and were merry and happy. In the evening when they sat down to dinner, three of them had to make music. One played the bassoon, the other the fiddle, and the third put the trumpet to his lips, and blew out his cheeks as much as he possibly could. When they had dined, the table was carried away, and the cat said, \"Now, Hans, come and dance with me.\" - \"No,\" said he, \"I won\'t dance with a pussy cat. I have never done that yet.\" - \"Then take him to bed,\" said she to the cats. So one of them lighted him to his bed-room, one pulled his shoes off, one his stockings, and at last one of them blew out the candle. Next morning they returned and helped him out of bed, one put his stockings on for him, one tied his garters, one brought his shoes, one washed him, and one dried his face with her tail. \"That feels very soft!\" said Hans. He, however, had to serve the cat, and chop some wood every day, and to do that, he had an axe of silver, and the wedge and saw were of silver and the mallet of copper. So he chopped the wood small; stayed there in the house and had good meat and drink, but never saw anyone but the tabby-cat and her servants. Once she said to him, \"Go and mow my meadow, and dry the grass,\" and gave him a scythe of silver, and a whetstone of gold, but bade him deliver them up again carefully. So Hans went thither, and did what he was bidden, and when he had finished the work, he carried the scythe, whetstone, and hay to the house, and asked if it was not yet time for her to give him his reward. \"No,\" said the cat, \"you must first do something more for me of the same kind. There is timber of silver, carpenter\'s axe, square, and everything that is needful, all of silver, with these build me a small house.\" Then Hans built the small house, and said that he had now done everything, and still he had no horse. Nevertheless the seven years had gone by with him as if they were six months. The cat asked him if he would like to see her horses? \"Yes,\" said Hans. Then she opened the door of the small house, and when she had opened it, there stood twelve horses, such horses, so bright and shining, that his heart rejoiced at the sight of them. And now she gave him to eat and drink, and said, \"Go home, I will not give thee thy horse away with thee; but in three days\' time I will follow thee and bring it.\" So Hans set out, and she showed him the way to the mill. She had, however, never once given him a new coat, and he had been obliged to keep on his dirty old smock-frock, which he had brought with him, and which during the seven years had everywhere become too small for him. When he reached home, the two other apprentices were there again as well, and each of them certainly had brought a horse with him, but one of them was a blind one, and the other lame. They asked Hans where his horse was. \"It will follow me in three days\' time.\" Then they laughed and said, \"Indeed, stupid Hans, where wilt thou get a horse?\" - \"It will be a fine one!\" Hans went into the parlour, but the miller said he should not sit down to table, for he was so ragged and torn, that they would all be ashamed of him if any one came in. So they gave him a mouthful of food outside, and at night, when they went to rest, the two others would not let him have a bed, and at last he was forced to creep into the goose-house, and lie down on a little hard straw. In the morning when he awoke, the three days had passed, and a coach came with six horses and they shone so bright that it was delightful to see them! and a servant brought a seventh as well, which was for the poor miller\'s boy. And a magnificent princess alighted from the coach and went into the mill, and this princess was the little tabby-cat whom poor Hans had served for seven years. She asked the miller where the miller\'s boy and drudge was? Then the miller said, \"We cannot have him here in the mill, for he is so ragged; he is lying in the goose-house.\" Then the King\'s daughter said that they were to bring him immediately. So they brought him out, and he had to hold his little smock-frock together to cover himself. The servants unpacked splendid garments, and washed him and dressed him, and when that was done, no King could have looked more handsome. Then the maiden desired to see the horses which the other apprentices had brought home with them, and one of them was blind and the other lame. So she ordered the servant to bring the seventh horse, and when the miller saw it, he said that such a horse as that had never yet entered his yard. \"And that is for the third miller\'s boy,\" said she. \"Then he must have the mill,\" said the miller, but the King\'s daughter said that the horse was there, and that he was to keep his mill as well, and took her faithful Hans and set him in the coach, and drove away with him. They first drove to the little house which he had built with the silver tools, and behold it was a great castle, and everything inside it was of silver and gold; and then she married him, and he was rich, so rich that he had enough for all the rest of his life. After this, let no one ever say that anyone who is silly can never become a person of importance.</string>
    <string name="story398text">There was once a King\'s son who went out into the world, and he was full of thought and sad. He looked at the sky, which was so beautifully pure and blue, then he sighed, and said, \"How well must all be with one up there in heaven!\" Then he saw a poor gray-haired man who was coming along the road towards him, and he spoke to him, and asked, \"How can I get to heaven?\" The man answered, \"By poverty and humility. Put on my ragged clothes, wander about the world for seven years, and get to know what misery is, take no money, but if thou art hungry ask compassionate hearts for a bit of bread; in this way thou wilt reach heaven.\"\nThen the King\'s son took off his magnificent coat, and wore in its place the beggar\'s garment, went out into the wide world, and suffered great misery. He took nothing but a little food, said nothing, but prayed to the Lord to take him into his heaven. When the seven years were over, he returned to his father\'s palace, but no one recognized him. He said to the servants, \"Go and tell my parents that I have come back again.\" But the servants did not believe it, and laughed and left him standing there. Then said he, \"Go and tell it to my brothers that they may come down, for I should so like to see them again.\" The servants would not do that either, but at last one of them went, and told it to the King\'s children, but these did not believe it, and did not trouble themselves about it. Then he wrote a letter to his mother, and described to her all his misery, but he did not say that he was her son. So, out of pity, the Queen had a place under the stairs assigned to him, and food taken to him daily by two servants. But one of them was ill-natured and said, \"Why should the beggar have the good food?\" and kept it for himself, or gave it to the dogs, and took the weak, wasted-away beggar nothing but water; the other, however, was honest, and took the beggar what was sent to him. It was little, but he could live on it for a while, and all the time he was quite patient, but he grew continually weaker. As, however, his illness increased, he desired to receive the last sacrament. When the host was being elevated down below, all the bells in the town and neighbourhood began to ring. After mass the priest went to the poor man under the stairs, and there he lay dead. In one hand he had a rose, in the other a lily, and beside him was a paper in which was written his history.\n\nWhen he was buried, a rose grew on one side of his grave, and a lily on the other.</string>
    <string name="story399text">Once upon a time, there was a king who had three daughters. He desired to find out which of the three loved him the most. So he called them forth, and posed the question to each: \"How much do you love me?\" The first said that she loved him more than the whole kingdom. The second that she loved him more than all the jewels and pearls in the world. When the third daughter declared that she loved him more than salt, he flew into a rage. Then he ordered his servant to carry the little girl into the woods and kill her.\n\nYet when they reached the lonely wood, the servant told her that he was devoted to her and would not have killed her under any circumstance. He was delighted to agree to her plan: that he make her a tunic of mouseskins, and leave her to make her own way. When it was done, the girl wrapped herself in it and went straight to the neighboring king and asked for employment. She had cut her hair short, and said she was a boy, and the king believed her, and took her on as his personal servant. Now it was the king\'s habit, when taking his boots off at night, to throw them at his serving boy\'s head. One night, the king asked the lad in mouseskins where he had come from. The youth replied: \"From the country where one doesn\'t toss boots at people\'s heads!\" From that moment, the king was suspicious of the boy, and set the other servants to spying on him. When they discovered a ring in the mouseskin boy\'s chamber, they brought it to the king. It was of such valued that they thought [s]he had stolen it. The king called Mouseskin to him and asked how she obtained the ring. That\'s when she realized that she could not hide herself any longer. She unwrapped the mouseskin, and her golden hair streamed down. As she stepped out of the skin, he could see she was beautiful, indeed so beautiful that he immediately took off his crown, put it on her head, and declared her to be his wife.\n\nA grand wedding was celebrated and all of the neighboring kings, including Mouseskin\'s very own father, were invited. But although the guests were entertained with the most delicious wines, the most graceful dancers, and the most elegant dishes, the food itself seemed to have no taste. One king became irritated and said: \"I\'d rather die than eat such food!\" No sooner had he uttered those words than his daughter, the new Queen, came to his side. That is when she said: \"Well, now you say you can\'t live without salt, but when I said I loved you more than salt, you wanted to have me killed.\" And all of a sudden, the grumpy old king realized that this young woman was none other than his youngest daughter, who he had believed to be long dead. In joy, he kissed her, and begged her forgiveness. Now that he had found her again, she was more dear to him than his kingdom and all the jewels in the world.</string>
    <string name="story400text">A miller had three sons, his mill, a donkey and a tom cat; the sons had to grind, the donkey had to get grain and carry flour away and the cat had to catch the mice away. When the miller died, the three brothers divided their inheritance, the oldest received the mill, the second the donkey and the third the tom cat, further was nothing left for him. Thereon he was sad ans spoke to himself: \"But I have gotten all the worst, my oldest brother can mill, my second can ride on his donkey, what can I start with the tom cat? Let me make a pair of fur gloves out of his pelt, so it\'s over.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said the tom cat, who had understood everything, what he said, \"you do not need to kill me, to get a pair of bad gloves from my pelt, let only a pair of boots be made for me, that I can go out, and be seen among the people, then you will soon be helped.\" The miller\'s son was in wonderment, that the tom cat so spoke, but because the shoemaker just walked by, he called him in, and let a pair of boots be measured for him. When they were ready, the tom cat put them on, took a sack, made the bottom of the same full of corn, but on the top a string, with which one could pull it closed, then he threw it over his back and went on two legs, like a human, out the door.\n\nIn those days reigned a king in the land, he liked to eat partridges so much: there was a need, that none were to be gotten. The whole forest was full, but they were so shy, that no hunter could reach them. The tom cat knew that and considered to do his matter better; when he came into the forest, he made the sack open, spread the corn apart, but the cord he laid into the grass and led it behind a hedge. There he hid himself, snuck around and lurked. The partridges soon came running, and one after the other hopped into the sack. When a good quantity was in it, the tom cat pulled the cord closed, ran to and twisted their heads around; then he threw the sack over his shoulder and went straight away to the king\'s palace. The watch cried: \"Halt! Whereto?\" - \"To the king,\" answered the tom cat quickly. - \"Are you crazed, a tom cat to the king?\" - \"Just let him go, said another, the king has often boredom, maybe the tom cat makes him amused with his humming and spinning. When the tom cat came in front of the king, he made a Reverence and said: \"My Herr, the Graf, with that he named his long and distinguished name, lets himself be recommended to the Herr King and sends him these partridges, that he just caught in slings. The king astonished over the beautiful fat partridges, knew not out of pleasure how to contain himself, and commanded that the tom cat be given as much gold out of the treasure chamber into his sack, as he could carry: \"That bring to your Herren and thank him again many times for his gift.\"\n\nBut the poor miller\'s son sat at home at the window, supported his head an his hand and thought, that he had spent his last for the tom cat\'s boots, and what large things will he be able to bring back. Thereon the tom cat stepped in, threw the sack from his hack, untied it open and shook the gold in front of the miller: \"There you have something for the hoots, the king also greets you and says many thanks to you.\" The miller was glad over the wealth, without understanding rightly, how it came to be. But the tom cat, as he took off his boots, told him everything, then he said: \"You do have money enough now, but it should not stay with that, tomorrow I will put my boots on again, you will become richer still, I also told the king, that you are a Graf.\" On the next day the torn cat went, as he had said, well booted to hunting again, and brought the king a rich catch. So it went all days, and the tom cat brought gold home all days, and was so popular as one by the king, that he was allowed to come in and go out and prowl around in the palace, where he wanted. One time the tom cat stood in the king\'s kitchen by the stove and warmed himself, thereon came the coach man and cursed: \"I wish king and the princess were at the executioner! I wanted to go to Wirtshaus and drink once and play cards, there I should drive them spazieren at the lake.\" As the tom cat heard that, he snuck home and told his Herrn: \"If a Graf you want to be and become rich, so come outside with me to the lake and bathe yourself therein.\" The miller did not know, what he should say to that, but followed the tom cat, went with him, undressed splinter naked and sprang into the water. But the tom cat took his clothes, carried them away and hid them. No sooner was he finished with that, thereon came the king driving by; the tom cat immediately began, pathetically to lament: \"Ach! All merciful king! Mein Herr, bathed himself here in the lake, thereon a thief came and stole his clothes, that lay on the shore, now the Herr Graf is in the water and can not come out, and if he stays in longer he will calch cold and die.\" When the king heard that, he called halt and one of his people had to chase back and of the king\'s clothes bring hack. The Herr Graf put on the magnificent clothes, and because the king anyway for the partridges, that he thought to have received from him, held his worth, so he had to sit with them in the carriage. The princess was also not upset over it, because the Graf was young and handsome, and she liked him quite well.\n\nBut the tom cat went ahead and came to a large grass field, where over a hundred people were making hay. \"Who does this grass field belong to, you people?\" said the tom cat. - \"The great magician.\" - \"Listen, the king will soon drive by, when he asks, who the grass field belongs to, so answer: the Grafen; and if you do not do that, you will all be struck dead.\" Thereon the tom cat went further and came to a grain field, so large, that no one could oversee it, there stood more than two hundred people and cut the grain. \"Who\'s grain is this you people?\" - \"The magician.\" - \"Listen, the king will drive by now, when he asks, who the grain belongs to, so answer: the Grafen; and if you do not do that, vou will all be struck dead.\" - Finally the tom cat came to a magnificent forest, there stood more than three hundred people, felled the big oaks and made wood. - \"Who\'s forest is this, you people?\" - \"The magician.\" - \"Listen, the king will drive by now, when he asks, who the forest belongs to so answer: the Grafen; and if you do not do that, you will all be killed.\" The tom cat went still furlher, the people all looked after him, and because he looked so wonderly, and as a human walked in the boots, they were afraid of him. He soon came to the magicians palace, stepped boldly in and in front of him. The magician looked at him contemptuously, and asked him, what he wanted. The tom cat made a Reverenz and said: \"I have beard, that vou could transform yourself into every animal you chose by your own will; what a hound, fox, or even wolf concerns, that I will well believe, but of an elephant, that seems to me quite impossible, and therefore I have come to convince myself.\" The magician said proudly: \"That is a trifle to me,\" and in that wink-of-an-eye was transformed into an elephant. \"That is much, but also in a lion?\" - \"That is also nothing,\" said the magician and stood as a lion in front of the tom cat. The tom cat made as if startled, and cried: \"That is unbelievable and unheard of, the same I would never had dreamt of coming into my thoughts; but more still, all else, it would be, if you could transform yourself into such a small animal, as a mouse is, you can certainly do more, than any other magician in the world, but that will be certainly too high for you. The magician was very friendly from the sweet words and said: \"O\'ja, dear cat-let, that I can also,\" and sprang as a mouse around the room. The tom cat was after him, caught the mouse with one jump and ate him up.\n\nBut the king was still driving spazieren with the Grafen and the princess, and came to the large field. \"Who does the hay belong to?\" asked the king - \"The Herr Grafen\" - cried all, as the tom cat had commanded them. - \"Thou have a pretty piece of land, Herr Graf,\" said he. Thereafter they came to the large grain field: \"Who does the grain belong to, you people?\" - \"The Herrn Grafen.\" - \"Ei! Herr Graf! large, big estates!\" - \"Thereon to the forest: \"who does the wood belong to, you people?\" - \"The Herrn Grafen.\" - The king was astonished even more and said: \"Thou must be a rich man, Herr Graf, I do not believe, that I have such a magnificent forest.\" Finally they came to the palace, the tom cat stood on top of the stairs, and as the wagon stopped below, he sprang down, opened the door and said: \"Herr King, thou comest to the palace of my Herr, the Graf, that this honors him and makes him happv his life day long.\" The king stepped out and marveled at the magnificent building, that was almost larger and more beautiful, than his own palace; but the Graf led the princess up the stairs into the hall, that was shimmering with gold and precious stones.\n\nThereon the princess was promised to the Graf, and when the king died, he was king, but the booted tom cat became first minister.</string>
    <string name="story401text">Two king\'s sons once started to seek adventures, and fell into a wild, reckless way of living, and gave up all thoughts of going home again. Their third and youngest brother, who was called Witling, and had remained behind, started off to seek them; and when at last he found them, they jeered at his simplicity in thinking that he could make his way in the world, while they who were so much cleverer were unsuccessful.\n\nBut they all three went on together until they came to an ant-hill, which the two eldest brothers wished to stir up, that they might see the little ants hurry about in their fright and carrying off their eggs, but Witling said, \"Leave the little creatures alone, I will not suffer them to be disturbed.\"\n\nAnd they went on farther until they came to a lake, where a number of ducks were swimming about. The two eldest brothers wanted to catch a couple and cook them, but Witling would not allow it, and said, \"Leave the creatures alone, I will not suffer them to be killed.\"\n\nAnd then they came to a bee\'s-nest in a tree, and there was so much honey in it that it overflowed and ran down the trunk. The two eldest brothers then wanted to make a fire beneath the tree, that the bees might be stifled by the smoke, and then they could get at the honey. But Witling prevented them, saying, \"Leave the little creatures alone, I will not suffer them to be stifled.\"\n\nAt last the three brothers came to a castle where there were in the stables many horses standing, all of stone, and the brothers went through all the rooms until they came to a door at the end secured with three locks, and in the middle of the door a small opening through which they could look into the room. And they saw a little grey-haired man sitting at a table. They called out to him once, twice, and he did not hear, but at the third time he got up, undid the locks, and came out. Without speaking a word he led them to a table loaded with all sorts of good things, and when they had eaten and drunk he showed to each his bed-chamber.\n\nThe next morning the little grey man came to the eldest brother, and beckoning him, brought him to a table of stone, on which were written three things directing by what means the castle could be delivered from its enchantment The first thing was, that in the wood under the moss lay the pearls belonging to the princess - a thousand in number - and they were to be sought for and collected, and if he who should undertake the task had not finished it by sunset, if but one pearl were missing, he must be turned to stone. So the eldest brother went out, and searched all day, but at the end of it he had only found one hundred; just as was said on the table of stone came to pass and he was turned into stone. The second brother undertook the adventure next day, but it fared with him no better than with the first; he found two hundred pearls, and was turned into stone. And so at last it was Witling\'s turn, and he began to search in the moss; but it was a very tedious business to find the pearls, and he grew so out of heart that he sat down on a stone and began to weep. As he was sitting thus, up came the ant-king with five thousand ants, whose lives had been saved through Witling\'s pity, and it was not very long before the little insects had collected all the pearls and put them in a heap.\n\nNow the second thing ordered by the table of stone was to get the key of the princess\'s sleeping-chamber out of the lake. And when Witling came to the lake, the ducks whose lives he had saved came swimming, and dived below, and brought up the key from the bottom.\n\nThe third thing that had to be done was the most difficult, and that was to choose out the youngest and loveliest of the three princesses, as they lay sleeping. All bore a perfect resemblance each to the other, and only differed in this, that before they went to sleep each one had eaten a different sweetmeat, the eldest a piece of sugar, the second a little syrup, and the third a spoonful of honey. Now the Queen-bee of those bees that Witling had protected from the fire came at this moment, and trying the lips of all three, settled on those of the one that had eaten honey, and so it was that the king\'s son knew which to choose.\n\nThen the spell was broken; every one awoke from stony sleep, and took their right form again. And Witling married the youngest and loveliest princess, and became king after her father\'s death. But his two brothers had to put up with the two other sisters.</string>
    <string name="story402text">There was once a woman who lived with her daughter in a beautiful cabbage-garden; and there came a rabbit and ate up all the cabbages. At last said the woman to her daughter, \"Go into the garden, and drive out the rabbit.\" - \"Shoo! shoo!\" said the maiden; \"don\'t eat up all our cabbages, little rabbit!\" - \"Come, maiden,\" said the rabbit, \"sit on my tail and go with me to my rabbit-hutch.\" But the maiden would not. Another day, back came the rabbit, and ate away at the cabbages, until the woman said to her daughter, \"Go into the garden, and drive away the rabbit.\" - \"Shoo! shoo!\" said the maiden; \"don\'t eat up all our cabbages, little rabbit!\" - \"Come, maiden,\" said the rabbit, \"sit on my tail and go with me to my rabbit-hutch.\" But the maiden would not. Again, a third time back came the rabbit, and ate away at the cabbages, until the woman said to her daughter, \"Go into the garden, and drive away the rabbit.\" - \"Shoo! shoo!\" said the maiden; \"don\'t eat up all our cabbages, little rabbit!\" - \"Come, maiden,\" said the rabbit, \"sit on my tail and go with me to my rabbit-hutch.\" And then the girl seated herself on the rabbit\'s tail, and the rabbit took her to his hutch. \"Now,\" said he, \"set to work and cook some bran and cabbage; I am going to bid the wedding guests.\" And soon they were all collected. Would you like to know who they were? Well, I can only tell you what was told to me; all the hares came, and the crow who was to be the parson to marry them, and the fox for the clerk, and the altar was under the rainbow.\n\nBut the maiden was sad, because she was so lonely. \"Get up! get up!\" said the rabbit, \"the wedding folk are all merry.\" But the bride wept and said nothing, and the rabbit went away, but very soon came back again. \"Get up! get up!\" said he, \"the wedding folk are waiting.\" But the bride said nothing, and the rabbit went away. Then she made a figure of straw, and dressed it in her own clothes, and gave it a red mouth, and set it to watch the kettle of bran, and then she went home to her mother. Back again came the rabbit, saying, \"Get up! get up!\" and he went up and hit the straw figure on the head, so that it tumbled down.\n\nAnd the rabbit thought that he had killed his bride, and he went away and was very sad.\n</string>
    <string name="story403text">There was once upon a time a Queen who had a little daughter who was still so young that she had to be carried. One day the child was naughty, and the mother might say what she liked, but the child would not be quiet. Then she became impatient, and as the ravens were flying about the palace, she opened the window and said, \"I wish you were a raven and would fly away, and then I should have some rest.\" Scarcely had she spoken the words, before the child was changed into a raven, and flew from her arms out of the window. It flew into a dark forest, and stayed in it a long time, and the parents heard nothing of their child. Then one day a man was on his way through this forest and heard the raven crying, and followed the voice, and when he came nearer, the bird said, \"I am a king\'s daughter by birth, and am bewitched, but thou canst set me free.\" - \"What am I to do,\" asked he. She said, \"Go further into the forest, and thou wilt find a house, wherein sits an aged woman, who will offer thee meat and drink, but you must accept nothing, for if you eatest and drinkest anything, thou wilt fall into a sleep, and then thou wilt not be able to deliver me. In the garden behind the house there is a great heap of tan, and on this thou shalt stand and wait for me. For three days I will come every afternoon at two o\'clock in a carriage. On the first day four white horses will be harnessed to it, then four chestnut horses, and lastly four black ones; but if thou art not awake, but sleeping, I shall not be set free.\" The man promised to do everything that she desired, but the raven said, alas, \"I know already that thou wilt not deliver me; thou wilt accept something from the woman.\" Then the man once more promised that he would certainly not touch anything either to eat or to drink. But when he entered the house the old woman came to him and said, \"Poor man, how faint you are; come and refresh yourself; eat and drink.\" - \"No,\" said the man, \"I will not eat or drink.\" She, however, let him have no peace, and said, \"If you will not eat, take one drink out of the glass; one is nothing.\" Then he let himself be persuaded, and drank. Shortly before two o\'clock in the afternoon he went into the garden to the tan heap to wait for the raven. As he was standing there, his weariness all at once became so great that he could not struggle against it, and lay down for a short time, but he was determined not to go to sleep. Hardly, however, had he lain down, than his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell asleep and slept so soundly that nothing in the world could have aroused him. At two o\'clock the raven came driving up with four white horses, but she was already in deep grief and said, \"I know he is asleep.\" And when she came into the garden, he was indeed lying there asleep on the heap of tan. She alighted from the carriage, went to him, shook him, and called him, but he did not awake. Next day about noon, the old woman came again and brought him food and drink, but he would not take any of it. But she let him have no rest and persuaded him until at length he again took one drink out of the glass. Towards two o\'clock he went into the garden to the tan heap to wait for the raven, but all at once felt such a great weariness that his limbs would no longer support him. He could not help himself, and was forced to lie down, and fell into a heavy sleep. When the raven drove up with four brown horses, she was already full of grief, and said, \"I know he is asleep.\" She went to him, but there he lay sleeping, and there was no wakening him. Next day the old woman asked what was the meaning of this? He was neither eating nor drinking anything; did he want to die? He replied, \"I am not allowed to eat or drink, and will not do so.\" But she set a dish with food, and a glass with wine before him, and when he smelt it he could not resist, and swallowed a deep draught. When the time came, he went out into the garden to the heap of tan, and waited for the King\'s daughter; but he became still more weary than on the day before, and lay down and slept as soundly as if he had been a stone. At two o\'clock the raven came with four black horses, and the coachman and everything else was black. She was already in the deepest grief, and said, \"I know that he is asleep and cannot deliver me.\" When she came to him, there he was lying fast asleep. She shook him and called him, but she could not waken him. Then she laid a loaf beside him, and after that a piece of meat, and thirdly a bottle of wine, and he might consume as much of all of them as he liked, but they would never grow less. After this she took a gold ring from her finger, and put it on his, and her name was graven on it. Lastly, she laid a letter beside him wherein was written what she had given him, and that none of the things would ever grow less; and in it was also written, \"I see right well that here you will never be able to deliver me, but if thou art still willing to deliver me, come to the golden castle of Stromberg; it lies in thy power, of that I am certain.\" And when she had given him all these things, she seated herself in her carriage, and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.\nWhen the man awoke and saw that he had slept, he was sad at heart, and said, \"She has certainly driven by, and I have not set her free.\" Then he perceived the things which were lying beside him, and read the letter wherein was written how everything had happened. So he arose and went away, intending to go to the golden castle of Stromberg, but he did not know where it was. After he had walked about the world for a long time, he entered into a dark forest, and walked for fourteen days, and still could not find his way out. Then it was once more evening, and he was so tired that he lay down in a thicket and fell asleep. Next day he went onwards, and in the evening, as he was again about to lie down beneath some bushes, he heard such a howling and crying that he could not go to sleep. And at the time when people light the candles, he saw one glimmering, and arose and went towards it. Then he came to a house which seemed very small, for in front of it a great giant was standing. He thought to himself, \"If I go in, and the giant sees me, it will very likely cost me my life.\"\n\nAt length he ventured it and went in. When the giant saw him, he said, \"It is well that thou comest, for it is long since I have eaten; I will at once eat thee for my supper.\" - \"I\'d rather you would leave that alone,\" said the man, \"I do not like to be eaten; but if thou hast any desire to eat, I have quite enough here to satisfy thee.\" - \"If that be true,\" said the giant, \"thou mayst be easy, I was only going to devour thee because I had nothing else.\" Then they went, and sat down to the table, and the man took out the bread, wine, and meat which would never come to an end. \"This pleases me well,\" said the giant, and ate to his heart\'s content. Then the man said to him, Canst thou tell me where the golden castle of Stromberg is?\" The giant said, \"I will look at my map; all the towns, and villages, and houses are to be found on it.\" He brought out the map which he had in the room and looked for the castle, but it was not to be found on it. \"It\'s no matter!\" said he, \"I have some still larger maps in my cupboard upstairs, and we will look in them.\" But there, too, it was in vain. The man now wanted to go onwards, but the giant begged him to wait a few days longer until his brother, who had gone out to bring some provisions, came home. When the brother came home they inquired about the golden castle of Stromberg. He replied, \"When I have eaten and have had enough, I will look in the map.\" Then he went with them up to his chamber, and they searched in his map, but could not find it. Then he brought out still older maps, and they never rested until they found the golden castle of Stromberg, but it was many thousand miles away. \"How am I to get there?\" asked the man. The giant said, \"I have two hours\' time, during which I will carry you into the neighbourhood, but after that I must be at home to suckle the child that we have.\" So the giant carried the man to about a hundred leagues from the castle, and said, \"Thou canst very well walk the rest of the way alone.\" And he turned back, but the man went onwards day and night, until at length he came to the golden castle of Stromberg. It stood on a glass-mountain, and the bewitched maiden drove in her carriage round the castle, and then went inside it. He rejoiced when he saw her and wanted to climb up to her, but when he began to do so he always slipped down the glass again. And when he saw that he could not reach her, he was filled with trouble, and said to himself, \"I will stay down here below, and wait for her.\" So he built himself a hut and stayed in it for a whole year, and every day saw the King\'s daughter driving about above, but never could go to her. Then one day he saw from his hut three robbers who were beating each other, and cried to them, \"God be with ye!\" They stopped when they heard the cry, but as they saw no one, they once more began to beat each other, and that too most dangerously. So he again cried, \"God be with ye!\" Again they stopped, looked round about, but as they saw no one they went on beating each other. Then he cried for the third time, \"God be with ye,\" and thought, \"I must see what these three are about,\" and went thither and asked why they were beating each other so furiously. One of them said that he found a stick, and that when he struck a door with it, that door would spring open. The next said that he had found a mantle, and that whenever he put it on, he was invisible, but the third said he had found a horse on which a man could ride everywhere, even up the glass-mountain. And now they did not know whether they ought to have these things in common, or whether they ought to divide them. Then the man said, \"I will give you something in exchange for these three things. Money indeed have I not, but I have other things of more value; but first I must try yours to see if you have told the truth.\" Then they put him on the horse, threw the mantle round him, and gave him the stick in his hand, and when he had all these things they were no longer able to see him. So he gave them some vigorous blows and cried, \"Now, vagabonds, you have got what you deserve, are you satisfied?\" And he rode up the glass-mountain, but when he came in front of the castle at the top, it was shut. Then he struck the door with his stick, and it sprang open immediately. He went in and ascended the stairs until he came to the hall where the maiden was sitting with a golden cup full of wine before her. She, however, could not see him because he had the mantle on. And when he came up to her, he drew from his finger the ring which she had given him, and threw it into the cup so that it rang. Then she cried, \"That is my ring, so the man who is to set me free must be here.\" They searched the whole castle and did not find him, but he had gone out, and had seated himself on the horse and thrown off the mantle. When they came to the door, they saw him and cried aloud in their delight.* Then he alighted and took the King\'s daughter in his arms, but she kissed him and said, \"Now hast thou set me free, and to-morrow we will celebrate our wedding.\"</string>
    <string name="story404text">There was once a King\'s son who was seized with a desire to travel about the world, and took no one with him but a faithful servant. One day he came to a great forest, and when darkness overtook him he could find no shelter, and knew not where to pass the night. Then he saw a girl who was going towards a small house, and when he came nearer, he saw that the maiden was young and beautiful. He spoke to her, and said, \"Dear child, can I and my servant find shelter for the night in the little house?\" - \"Oh, yes,\" said the girl in a sad voice, \"that you certainly can, but I do not advise you to venture it. Do not go in.\" - \"Why not?\" asked the King\'s son. The maiden sighed and said, \"My step-mother practises wicked arts; she is ill-disposed toward strangers.\" Then he saw very well that he had come to the house of a witch, but as it was dark, and he could not go farther, and also was not afraid, he entered. The old woman was sitting in an armchair by the fire, and looked at the stranger with her red eyes. \"Good evening,\" growled she, and pretended to be quite friendly. \"Take a seat and rest yourselves.\" She blew up the fire on which she was cooking something in a small pot. The daughter warned the two to be prudent, to eat nothing, and drink nothing, for the old woman brewed evil drinks. They slept quietly until early morning. When they were making ready for their departure, and the King\'s son was already seated on his horse, the old woman said, \"Stop a moment, I will first hand you a parting draught.\" Whilst she fetched it, the King\'s son rode away, and the servant who had to buckle his saddle tight, was the only one present when the wicked witch came with the drink. \"Take that to your master,\" said she. But at that instant the glass broke and the poison spirted on the horse, and it was so strong that the animal immediately fell down dead. The servant ran after his master and told him what had happened, but would not leave his saddle behind him, and ran back to fetch it. When, however, he came to the dead horse a raven was already sitting on it devouring it. \"Who knows whether we shall find anything better to-day?\" said the servant; so he killed the raven, and took it with him. And now they journeyed onwards into the forest the whole day, but could not get out of it. By nightfall they found an inn and entered it. The servant gave the raven to the innkeeper to make ready for supper. They had, however, stumbled on a den of murderers, and during the darkness twelve of these came, intending to kill the strangers and rob them. Before they set about this work, they sat down to supper, and the innkeeper and the witch sat down with them, and together they ate a dish of soup in which was cut up the flesh of the raven. Hardly, however, had they swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, before they all fell down dead, for the raven had communicated to them the poison from the horse-flesh. There was no no one else left in the house but the innkeeper\'s daughter, who was honest, and had taken no part in their godless deeds. She opened all doors to the stranger and showed him the heaped-up treasures. But the King\'s son said she might keep everything, he would have none of it, and rode onwards with his servant.\nAfter they had traveled about for a long time, they came to a town in which was a beautiful but proud princess, who had caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever should set her a riddle which she could not guess, that man should be her husband; but if she guessed it, his head must be cut off. She had three days to guess it in, but was so clever that she always found the answer to the riddle given her, before the appointed time. Nine suitors had already perished in this manner, when the King\'s son arrived, and blinded by her great beauty, was willing to stake his life for it. Then he went to her and laid his riddle before her. \"What is this?\" said he, \"One slew none, and yet slew twelve.\" She did not know what that was, she thought and thought, but she could not find out, she opened her riddle-books, but it was not in them — in short, her wisdom was at an end. As she did not know how to help herself, she ordered her maid to creep into the lord\'s sleeping-chamber, and listen to his dreams, and thought that he would perhaps speak in his sleep and discover the riddle. But the clever servant had placed himself in the bed instead of his master, and when the maid came there, he tore off from her the mantle in which she had wrapped herself, and chased her out with rods. The second night the King\'s daughter sent her maid-in-waiting, who was to see if she could succeed better in listening, but the servant took her mantle also away from her, and hunted her out with rods. Now the master believed himself safe for the third night, and lay down in his own bed. Then came the princess herself, and she had put on a misty-grey mantle, and she seated herself near him. And when she thought that he was asleep and dreaming, she spoke to him, and hoped that he would answer in his sleep, as many do, but he was awake, and understood and heard everything quite well. Then she asked, \"One slew none, what is that?\" He replied, \"A raven, which ate of a dead and poisoned horse, and died of it.\" She inquired further, \"And yet slew twelve, what is that?\" He answered, \"That means twelve murderers, who ate the raven and died of it.\"\n\nWhen she knew the answer to the riddle she wanted to steal away, but he held her mantle so fast that she was forced to leave it behind her. Next morning, the King\'s daughter announced that she had guessed the riddle, and sent for the twelve judges and expounded it before them. But the youth begged for a hearing, and said, \"She stole into my room in the night and questioned me, otherwise she could not have discovered it.\" The judges said, \"Bring us a proof of this.\" Then were the three mantles brought thither by the servant, and when the judges saw the misty-grey one which the King\'s daughter usually wore, they said, \"Let the mantle be embroidered with gold and silver, and then it will be your wedding-mantle.\"</string>
    <string name="story405text">Three women were changed into flowers which grew in the field, but one of them was allowed to be in her own home at night. Then once when day was drawing near, and she was forced to go back to her companions in the field and become a flower again, she said to her husband: \"If thou wilt come this afternoon and gather me, I shall be set free and henceforth stay with thee.\" And he did so. Now the question is, how did her husband know her, for the flowers were exactly alike, and without any difference?\n\nAnswer: \"As she was at her home during the night and not in the field, no dew fell on her as it did on the others, and by this her husband knew her.\"</string>
    <string name="story406text">There was once a miller who had a beautiful daughter, and when she was grown up he became anxious that she should be well married and taken care of; so he thought, \"If a decent sort of man comes and asks her in marriage, I will give her to him.\" Soon after a suitor came forward who seemed very well to do, and as the miller knew nothing to his disadvantage, he promised him his daughter. But the girl did not seem to love him as a bride should love her bridegroom; she had no confidence in him; as often as she saw him or thought about him, she felt a chill at her heart. One day he said to her, \"You are to be my bride, and yet you have never been to see me.\" The girl answered, \"I do not know where your house is.\" Then he said, \"My house is a long way in the wood.\" She began to make excuses, and said she could not find the way to it; but the bridegroom said, \"You must come and pay me a visit next Sunday; I have already invited company, and I will strew ashes on the path through the wood, so that you will be sure to find it.\"\n\nWhen Sunday came, and the girl set out on her way, she felt very uneasy without knowing exactly why; and she filled both pockets full of peas and lentils. There were ashes strewed on the path through the wood, but, nevertheless, at each step she cast to the right and left a few peas on the ground. So she went on the whole day until she came to the middle of the wood, where it was the darkest, and there stood a lonely house, not pleasant in her eyes, for it was dismal and unhomelike. She walked in, but there was no one there, and the greatest stillness reigned. Suddenly she heard a voice cry,\n\n\"Turn back, turn back, thou pretty bride,\nWithin this house thou must not bide,\nFor here do evil things betide.\"\n\nThe girl glanced round, and perceived that the voice came from a bird who was hanging in a cage by the wall. And again it cried,\n\n\"Turn back, turn back, thou pretty bride,\nWithin this house thou must not bide,\nFor here do evil things betide.\"\n\nThen the pretty bride went on from one room into another through the whole house, but it was quite empty, and no soul to be found in it. At last she reached the cellar, and there sat a very old woman nodding her head. \"Can you tell me,\" said the bride, \"if my bridegroom lives here?\" - \"Oh, poor child,\" answered the old woman, \"do you know what has happened to you? You are in a place of cutthroats. You thought you were a bride, and soon to be married, but death will be your spouse. Look here, I have a great kettle of water to set on, and when once they have you in their power they will cut you in pieces without mercy, cook you, and eat you, for they are cannibals. Unless I have pity on you, and save you, all is over with you!\"\n\nThen the old woman hid her behind a great cask, where she could not be seen. \"Be as still as a mouse,\" said she; \"do not move or go away, or else you are lost. At night, when the robbers are asleep, we will escape. I have been waiting a long time for an opportunity.\" No sooner was it settled than the wicked gang entered the house. They brought another young woman with them, dragging her along, and they were drunk, and would not listen to her cries and groans. They gave her wine to drink, three glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow, and then they cut her in pieces. The poor bride all the while shaking and trembling when she saw what a fate the robbers had intended for her. One of them noticed on the little finger of their victim a golden ring, and as he could not draw it off easily, he took an axe and chopped it off, but the finger jumped away, and fell behind the cask on the bride\'s lap. The robber took up a light to look for it, but he could not find it. Then said one of the others, \"Have you looked behind the great cask?\" But the old woman cried, \"Come to supper, and leave off looking till to-morrow; the finger cannot run away.\"\n\nThen the robbers said the old woman was right, and they left off searching, and sat down to eat, and the old woman dropped some sleeping stuff into their wine, so that before long they stretched themselves on the cellar floor, sleeping and snoring. When the bride heard that, she came from behind the cask, and had to make her way among the sleepers lying all about on the ground, and she felt very much afraid lest she might awaken any of them. But by good luck she passed through, and the old woman with her, and they opened the door, and they made all haste to leave that house of murderers. The wind had carried away the ashes from the path, but the peas and lentils had budded and sprung up, and the moonshine upon them showed the way. And they went on through the night, till in the morning they reached the mill. Then the girl related to her father all that had happened to her.\n\nWhen the wedding-day came, the friends and neighbours assembled, the miller having invited them, and the bridegroom also appeared. When they were all seated at table, each one had to tell a story. But the bride sat still, and said nothing, till at last the bridegroom said to her, \"Now, sweetheart, do you know no story? Tell us something.\" She answered, \"I will tell you my dream. I was going alone through a wood, and I came at last to a house in which there was no living soul, but by the wall was a bird in a cage, who cried,\n\n\"Turn back, turn back, thou pretty bride,\nWithin this house thou must not bide,\nFor evil things do here betide.\"\n\nAnd then again it said it. Sweetheart, the dream is not ended. Then I went through all the rooms, and they were all empty, and it was so lonely and wretched. At last I went down into the cellar, and there sat an old old woman, nodding her head. I asked her if my bridegroom lived in that house, and she answered, \' Ah, poor child, you have come into a place of cut-throats; your bridegroom does live here, but he will kill you and cut you in pieces, and then cook and eat you.\' Sweetheart, the dream is not ended. But the old woman hid me behind a great cask, and no sooner had she done so than the robbers came home, dragging with them a young woman, and they gave her to drink wine thrice, white, red, and yellow. Sweetheart, the dream is not yet ended. And then they killed her, and cut her in pieces. Sweetheart, my dream is not yet ended. And one of the robbers saw a gold ring on the finger of the young woman, and as it was difficult to get off, he took an axe and chopped off the finger, which jumped upwards, and then fell behind the great cask on my lap. And here is the finger with the ring!\" At these words she drew it forth, and showed it to the company.\n\nThe robber, who during the story had grown deadly white, sprang up, and would have escaped, but the folks held him fast, and delivered him up to justice. And he and his whole gang were, for their evil deeds, condemned and executed.</string>
    <string name="story407text">There was once a woman who was a witch, and she had two daughters, one ugly and wicked, whom she loved the best, because she was her very own daughter, and one pretty and good, whom she hated because she was her step-daughter.\n\nOne day the stepdaughter put on a pretty apron, which the other daughter liked so much that she became envious, and said to her mother that she must and should have the apron. \"Be content, my child,\" said the old woman, \"thou shalt have it. Thy step-sister has long deserved death, and tonight, while she is asleep, I shall come and cut off her head. Take care to lie at the farthest side of the bed, and push her to the outside.\"\n\nAnd it would have been all over with the poor girl, if she had not been standing in a corner near and heard it all. She did not dare to go outside the door the whole day long, and when bed-time came the other one got into bed first, so as to lie on the farthest side; but when she had gone to sleep, the step-daughter pushed her towards the outside, and took the inside place next the wall. In the night the old woman came sneaking; in her right hand she held an axe, and with her left she felt for the one who was lying outside, and then she heaved up the axe with both hands, and hewed the head off her only daughter. When she had gone away, the other girl got up and went to her sweetheart\'s, who was called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came to her, she said, \"Listen, dear Roland, we must flee away in all haste; my step-mother meant to put me to death, but she has killed her only child instead. When the day breaks, and she sees what she has done, we are lost.\"\n\n\"But I advise you,\" said Roland, \"to bring away her magic wand with you; otherwise we cannot escape her when she comes after to overtake us.\" So the maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took up the head of her step-sister and let drop three drops of blood on the ground, - one by the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the steps. Then she hastened back to her sweetheart.\n\nWhen the old witch got up in the morning, she called out to her daughter, to give her the apron, but no daughter came. Then she cried out, \"Where art thou?\"\n\n\"Here, at the steps, sweeping!\" answered one of the drops of Wood. The old woman went out, but she saw nobody at the steps, and cried again, \"Where art thou?\"\n\n\"Here in the .kitchen warming myself,\" cried the second drop of blood. So she went into the kitchen and found no one. Then she cried again, \"Where art thou?\"\n\n\"Oh, here in bed fast asleep!\" cried the third drop of blood. Then the mother went into the room, and up to the bed, and there lay her only child, whose head she had cut off herself.\n\nThe witch fell into a great fury, rushed to the window, for from it she could see far and wide, and she caught sight of her step-daughter, hastening away with her dear Roland. \"It will be no good to you,\" cried she, \"if you get ever so far away, you cannot escape me.\"\n\nThen she put on her boots, which took her an hour\'s walk at every stride, and it was not long before she had overtaken them. But the maiden, when she saw the old woman striding up, changed, by means of the magic wand, her dear Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck swimming upon it. The witch stood on the bank and threw in crumbs of bread, and took great pains to decoy the duck towards her, but the duck would not be decoyed, and the old woman was obliged to go back in the evening disappointed.\n\nThen the maiden and her dear Roland took again their natural shapes, and travelled on the whole night through until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful flower, standing in the middle of a hedge of thorns, and her dear Roland into a fiddle-player. It was not long before the witch came striding up, and she said to the musician, \"Dear musician, will you be so kind as to reach that pretty flower for me?\" - \"Oh yes,\" said he, \"I will strike up a tune to it.\" Then as she crept quickly up to the hedge to break off the flower, for she knew well who it was, he began to play, and whether she liked it or not, she was obliged to dance, for there was magic in the tune. The faster he played the higher she had to jump, and the thorns tore her clothes, and scratched and wounded her, and he did not cease playing until she was spent, and lay dead.\n\nSo now they were saved, and Roland said, \"I will go to my father and prepare for the wedding.\" - \"And I will stay here,\" said the maiden, \"and wait for you, and so that no one should know me, I will change myself into a red milestone.\" So away went Roland, and the maiden in the likeness of a stone waited in the field for her beloved.\n\nBut when Roland went home he fell into the snares of another maiden, who wrought so, that he forgot his first love. And the poor girl waited a long time, but at last, seeing that he did not come, she was filled with despair, and changed herself into a flower, thinking \"Perhaps some one in passing will put his foot upon me and crush me.\"\n\nBut it happened that a shepherd, tending his flock, saw the flower, and as it was so beautiful, he gathered it, took it home with him, and put it in his chest. From that time everything went wonderfully well in the shepherd\'s house. When he got up in the morning, all the work was already done; the room was swept, the tables and benches rubbed, fire kindled on the hearth, and water ready drawn; and when he came home in the middle of the day, the table was laid, and a good meal spread upon it. He could not understand how it was done, for he never saw anybody in his house, and it was too little for anybody to hide in. The good serving pleased him well; but in the end he became uneasy, and went to a wise woman to take counsel of her. The wise woman said, \"There is magic in it: get up early some morning, and if you hear something moving in the room, be it what it may, throw a white cloth over it, and the charm will be broken.\" The shepherd did as she told him, and the next morning at daybreak he saw the chest open, and the flower come out.\n\nThen he jumped up quickly and threw a white cloth over it. So the spell was broken, and a lovely maiden stood before him; and she told him that she had been the flower, and had until now cared for his household matters. She told him all that had happened to her, and she pleased him so much that he asked her to marry him, but she answered \"No,\" because she still remained true to her dear Roland, though he had forsaken her; but she promised not to leave the shepherd, but to go on taking care of his house.\n\nNow the time came when Roland\'s wedding was to be held; and there was an old custom in that country that all the girls should be present, and should sing in honour of the bride and bridegroom. The faithful maiden, when she knew this, was so sorrowful that she felt as if her heart would break; and she would not go, until the others came and fetched her. And when her turn came to sing she slipped behind, so that she stood alone, and so began to sing.\n\nAnd as soon as her song reached Roland\'s ear he sprang up and cried, \"I know that voice! that is the right bride, and no other will I have.\" And everything that he had forgotten, and that had been swept out of his mind, came suddenly home to him in his heart. And the faithful maiden was married to her dear Roland; her sorrow came to an end and her joy began.</string>
    <string name="story408text">There was once a poor woman who had two children. The youngest had to go every day into the forest to fetch wood. Once when she had gone a long way to seek it, a little child, who was quite strong, came and helped her industriously to pick up the wood and carry it home, and then before a moment had passed the strange child disappeared. The child told her mother this, but at first she would not believe it. At length she brought a rose home, and told her mother that the beautiful child had given her this rose, and had told her that when it was in full bloom, he would return. The mother put the rose in water. One morning her child could not get out of bed, the mother went to the bed and found her dead, but she lay looking very happy. On the same morning, the rose was in full bloom.</string>
    <string name="story409text">There was once upon a time a princess, who, high under the battlements in her castle, had an apartment with twelve windows, which looked out in every possible direction, and when she climbed up to it and looked around her, she could inspect her whole kingdom. When she looked out of the first, her sight was more keen than that of any other human being; from the second she could see still better, from the third more distinctly still, and so it went on, until the twelfth, from which she saw everything above the earth and under the earth, and nothing at all could be kept secret from her. Moreover, as she was haughty, and would be subject to no one, but wished to keep the dominion for herself alone, she caused it to be proclaimed that no one should ever be her husband who could not conceal himself from her so effectually, that it should be quite impossible for her to find him. He who tried this, however, and was discovered by her, was to have his head struck off, and stuck on a post. Ninety-seven posts with the heads of dead men were already standing before the castle, and no one had come forward for a long time. The princess was delighted, and thought to herself, \"Now I shall be free as long as I live.\" Then three brothers appeared before her, and announced to her that they were desirous of trying their luck. The eldest believed he would be quite safe if he crept into a lime-pit, but she saw him from the first window, made him come out, and had his head cut off. The second crept into the cellar of the palace, but she perceived him also from the first window, and his fate was sealed. His head was placed on the nine and ninetieth post. Then the youngest came to her and entreated her to give him a day for consideration, and also to be so gracious as to overlook it if she should happen to discover him twice, but if he failed the third time, he would look on his life as over. As he was so handsome, and begged so earnestly, she said, \"Yes, I will grant thee that, but thou wilt not succeed.\"\nNext day he meditated for a long time how he should hide himself, but all in vain. Then he seized his gun and went out hunting. He saw a raven, took a good aim at him, and was just going to fire, when the bird cried, \"Don\'t shoot; I will make it worth thy while not.\" He put his gun down, went on, and came to a lake where he surprised a large fish which had come up from the depths below to the surface of the water. When he had aimed at it, the fish cried, \"Don\'t shoot, and I will make it worth thy while.\" He allowed it to dive down again, went onwards, and met a fox which was lame. He fired and missed it, and the fox cried, \"You had much better come here and draw the thorn out of my foot for me.\" He did this; but then he wanted to kill the fox and skin it, the fox said, \"Stop, and I will make it worth thy while.\" The youth let him go, and then as it was evening, returned home.\n\nNext day he was to hide himself; but howsoever much he puzzled his brains over it, he did not know where. He went into the forest to the raven and said, \"I let thee live on, so now tell me where I am to hide myself, so that the King\'s daughter shall not see me.\" The raven hung his head and thought it over for a longtime. At length he croaked, \"I have it.\" He fetched an egg out of his nest, cut it into two parts, and shut the youth inside it; then made it whole again, and seated himself on it. When the King\'s daughter went to the first window she could not discover him, nor could she from the others, and she began to be uneasy, but from the eleventh she saw him. She ordered the raven to be shot, and the egg to be brought and broken, and the youth was forced to come out. She said, \"For once thou art excused, but if thou dost not do better than this, thou art lost!\"\n\nNext day he went to the lake, called the fish to him and said, \"I suffered thee to live, now tell me where to hide myself so that the King\'s daughter may not see me.\" The fish thought for a while, and at last cried, \"I have it! I will shut thee up in my stomach.\" He swallowed him, and went down to the bottom of the lake. The King\'s daughter looked through her windows, and even from the eleventh did not see him, and was alarmed; but at length from the twelfth she saw him. She ordered the fish to be caught and killed, and then the youth appeared. Every one can imagine what a state of mind he was in. She said, \"Twice thou art forgiven, but be sure that thy head will be set on the hundredth post.\"\n\nOn the last day, he went with a heavy heart into the country, and met the fox. \"Thou knowest how to find all kinds of hiding-places,\" said he; \"I let thee live, now advise me where I shall hide myself so that the King\'s daughter shall not discover me.\" - \"That\'s a hard task,\" answered the fox, looking very thoughtful. At length he cried, \"I have it!\" and went with him to a spring, dipped himself in it, and came out as a stall-keeper in the market, and dealer in animals. The youth had to dip himself in the water also, and was changed into a small sea-hare. The merchant went into the town, and showed the pretty little animal, and many persons gathered together to see it. At length the King\'s daughter came likewise, and as she liked it very much, she bought it, and gave the merchant a good deal of money for it. Before he gave it over to her, he said to it, \"When the King\'s daughter goes to the window, creep quickly under the braids of he hair.\" And now the time arrived when she was to search for him. She went to one window after another in turn, from the first to the eleventh, and did not see him. When she did not see him from the twelfth either, she was full of anxiety and anger, and shut it down with such violence that the glass in every window shivered into a thousand pieces, and the whole castle shook.\n\nShe went back and felt the sea-hare beneath the braids of her hair. Then she seized it, and threw it on the ground exclaiming, \"Away with thee, get out of my sight!\" It ran to the merchant, and both of them hurried to the spring, wherein they plunged, and received back their true forms. The youth thanked the fox, and said, \"The raven and the fish are idiots compared with thee; thou knowest the right tune to play, there is no denying that!\"\n\nThe youth went straight to the palace. The princess was already expecting him, and accommodated herself to her destiny. The wedding was solemnized, and now he was king, and lord of all the kingdom. He never told her where he had concealed himself for the third time, and who had helped him, so she believed that he had done everything by his own skill, and she had a great respect for him, for she thought to herself, \"He is able to do more than I.\"\n</string>
    <string name="story410text">Seven Swabians were once together. The first was Master Schulz; the second, Jackli; the third, Marli; the fourth, Jergli; the fifth, Michal; the sixth, Hans; the seventh, Veitli: all seven had made up their minds to travel about the world to seek adventures, and perform great deeds. But in order that they might go in security and with arms in their hands, they thought it would be advisable that they should have one solitary, but very strong, and very long spear made for them. This spear all seven of them took in their hands at once; in front walked the boldest and bravest, and that was Master Schulz; all the others followed in a row, and Veitli was the last. Then it came to pass one day in the hay-making month (July), when they had walked a long distance, and still had a long way to go before they reached the village where they were to pass the night, that as they were in a meadow in the twilight a great beetle or hornet flew by them from behind a bush, and hummed in a menacing manner. Master Schulz was so terrified that he all but dropped the spear, and a cold perspiration broke out over his whole body. \"Hark! hark!\" cried he to his comrades, \"Good heavens! I hear a drum.\" Jackli, who was behind him holding the spear, and who perceived some kind of a smell, said, \"Something is most certainly going on, for I taste powder and matches.\" At these words Master Schulz began to take to flight, and in a trice jumped over a hedge, but as he just happened to jump on to the teeth of a rake which had been left lying there after the hay-making, the handle of it struck against his face and gave him a tremendous blow. \"Oh dear! Oh dear!\" screamed Master Schulz. \"Take me prisoner; I surrender! I surrender!\" The other six all leapt over, one on the top of the other, crying, \"If you surrender, I surrender too! If you surrender, I surrender too!\" At length, as no enemy was there to bind and take them away, they saw that they had been mistaken, and in order that the story might not be known, and they be treated as fools and ridiculed, they all swore to each other to hold their peace about it until one of them accidentally spoke of it. Then they journeyed onwards. The second danger which they survived cannot be compared with the first. Some days afterwards, their path led them through a fallow-field where a hare was sitting sleeping in the sun. Her ears were standing straight up, and her great glassy eyes were wide open. All of them were alarmed at the sight of the horrible wild beast, and they consulted together as to what it would be the least dangerous to do. For if they were to run away, they knew that the monster would pursue and swallow them whole. So they said, \"We must go through a great and dangerous struggle. Boldly ventured, is half won,\" and all seven grasped the spear, Master Schulz in front, and Veitli behind. Master Schulz was always trying to keep the spear back, but Veitli had become quite brave while behind, and wanted to dash forward and cried,\n\n\"Strike home, in every Swabian\'s name,\nOr else I wish ye may be lame.\"\nBut Hans knew how to meet this, and said,\n\n\"Thunder and lightning, it\'s fine to prate,\nBut for dragon-hunting thou\'rt aye too late.\"\nMichal cried,\n\n\"Nothing is wanting, not even a hair,\nBe sure the Devil himself is there.\"\nThen it was Jergli\'s turn to speak,\n\n\"If it be not, it\'s at least his mother,\nOr else it\'s the Devil\'s own step-brother.\"\nAnd now Marli had a bright thought, and said to Veitli,\n\n\"Advance, Veitli, advance, advance,\nAnd I behind will hold the lance.\"\nVeitli, however, did not attend to that, and Jackli said,\n\n\"Tis Schulz\'s place the first to be,\nNo one deserves that honor but he.\"\nThen Master Schulz plucked up his courage, and said, gravely,\n\n\"Then let us boldly advance to the fight,\nAnd thus we shall show our valour and might.\"\nHereupon they all together set on the dragon. Master Schulz crossed himself and prayed for God\'s assistance, but as all this was of no avail, and he was getting nearer and nearer to the enemy, he screamed \"Oho! oho! ho! ho! ho!\" in the greatest anguish. This awakened the hare, which in great alarm darted swiftly away. When Master Schulz saw her thus flying from the field of battle, he cried in his joy.\n\n\"Quick, Veitli, quick, look there, look there,\nThe monster\'s nothing but a hare!\"\nBut the Swabian allies went in search of further adventures, and came to the Moselle, a mossy, quiet, deep river, over which there are few bridges, and which in many places people have to cross in boats. As the seven Swabians did not know this, they called to a man who was working on the opposite side of the river, to know how people contrived to get across. The distance and their way of speaking made the man unable to understand what they wanted, and he said \"What? what?\" in the way people speak in the neighborhood of Treves. Master Schulz thought he was saying, \"Wade, wade through the water,\" and as he was the first, began to set out and went into the moselle. It was not long before he sank in the mud and the deep waves which drove against him, but his hat was blown on the opposite shore by the wind, and a frog sat down beside it, and croaked \"Wat, wat, wat.\" The other six on the opposite side heard that, and said, \"Oho, comrades, Master Schulz is calling us; if he can wade across, why cannot we?\" So they all jumped into the water together in a great hurry, and were drowned, and thus one frog took the lives of all six of them, and not one of the Swabian allies ever reached home again.</string>
    <string name="story411text">There was once a man who had seven sons, and still he had no daughter, however much he wished for one. At length his wife again gave him hope of a child, and when it came into the world it was a girl. The joy was great, but the child was sickly and small, and had to be privately baptized on account of its weakness. The father sent one of the boys in haste to the spring to fetch water for the baptism. The other six went with him, and as each of them wanted to be first to fill it, the jug fell into the well. There they stood and did not know what to do, and none of them dared to go home. As they still did not return, the father grew impatient, and said, \"They have certainly forgotten it for some game, the wicked boys!\" He became afraid that the girl would have to die without being baptized, and in his anger cried, \"I wish the boys were all turned into ravens.\" Hardly was the word spoken before he heard a whirring of wings over his head in the air, looked up and saw seven coal-black ravens flying away.\n\nThe parents could not recall the curse, and however sad they were at the loss of their seven sons, they still to some extent comforted themselves with their dear little daughter, who soon grew strong and every day became more beautiful. For a long time she did not know that she had had brothers, for her parents were careful not to mention them before her, but one day she accidentally heard some people saying of herself, \"that the girl was certainly beautiful, but that in reality she was to blame for the misfortune which had befallen her seven brothers.\" Then she was much troubled, and went to her father and mother and asked if it was true that she had had brothers, and what had become of them? The parents now dared keep the secret no longer, but said that what had befallen her brothers was the will of Heaven, and that her birth had only been the innocent cause. But the maiden took it to heart daily, and thought she must deliver her brothers. She had no rest or peace until she set out secretly, and went forth into the wide world to trace out her brothers and set them free, let it cost what it might. She took nothing with her but a little ring belonging to her parents as a keepsake, a loaf of bread against hunger, a little pitcher of water against thirst, and a little chair as a provision against weariness.\n\nAnd now she went continually onwards, far, far to the very end of the world. Then she came to the sun, but it was too hot and terrible, and devoured little children. Hastily she ran away, and ran to the moon, but it was far too cold, and also awful and malicious, and when it saw the child, it said, \"I smell, I smell the flesh of men.\" On this she ran swiftly away, and came to the stars, which were kind and good to her, and each of them sat on its own particular little chair. But the morning star arose, and gave her the drumstick of a chicken, and said, \"If you thou hast not that drumstick thou canst not open the Glass mountain, and in the Glass mountain are thy brothers.\"\n\nThe maiden took the drumstick, wrapped it carefully in a cloth, and went onwards again until she came to the Glass mountain. The door was shut, and she thought she would take out the drumstick; but when she undid the cloth, it was empty, and she had lost the good star\'s present. What was she now to do? She wished to rescue her brothers, and had no key to the Glass mountain. The good sister took a knife, cut off one of her little fingers, put it in the door, and succeeded in opening it. When she had gone inside, a little dwarf came to meet her, who said, \"My child, what are you looking for?\" - \"I am looking for my brothers, the seven ravens,\" she replied. The dwarf said, \"The lord ravens are not at home, but if you will wait here until they come, step in.\" Thereupon the little dwarf carried the ravens\' dinner in, on seven little plates, and in seven little glasses, and the little sister ate a morsel from each plate, and from each little glass she took a sip, but in the last little glass she dropped the ring which she had brought away with her.\n\nSuddenly she heard a whirring of wings and a rushing through the air, and then the little dwarf said, \"Now the lord ravens are flying home.\" Then they came, and wanted to eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said one after the other, \"Who has eaten something from my plate? Who has drunk out of my little glass? It was a human mouth.\" And when the seventh came to the bottom of the glass, the ring rolled against his mouth. Then he looked at it, and saw that it was a ring belonging to his father and mother, and said, \"God grant that our sister may be here, and then we shall be free.\" When the maiden, who was standing behind the door watching, heard that wish, she came forth, and on this all the ravens were restored to their human form again. And they embraced and kissed each other, and went joyfully home.</string>
    <string name="story412text">There was once a tailor, who was a quarrelsome fellow, and his wife, who was good, industrious, and pious, never could please him. Whatever she did, he was not satisfied, but grumbled and scolded, and knocked her about and beat her. As the authorities at last heard of it, they had him summoned, and put in prison in order to make him better. He was kept for a while on bread and water, and then set free again. He was forced, however, to promise not to beat his wife any more, but to live with her in peace, and share joy and sorrow with her, as married people ought to do. All went on well for a time, but then he fell into his old ways, and was surly and quarrelsome. And because he dared not beat her, he would seize her by the hair and tear it out. The woman escaped from him, and sprang out into the yard, but he ran after her with his yard-measure and scissors, and chased her about, and threw the yard-measure and scissors at her, and whatever else came his way. When he hit her he laughed, and when he missed her, he stormed and swore. This went on so long that the neighbors came to the wife\'s assistance. The tailor was again summoned before the magistrates, and reminded of his promise. \"Dear gentlemen,\" said he, \"I have kept my word, I have not beaten her, but have shared joy and sorrow with her.\" - \"How can that be,\" said the judge, \"when she continually brings such heavy complaints against you?\" - \"I have not beaten her, but just because she looked so strange I wanted to comb her hair with my hand; she, however, got away from me, and left me quite spitefully. Then I hurried after her, and in order to bring her back to her duty, I threw at her as a well-meant admonition whatever came readily to hand. I have shared joy and sorrow with her also, for whenever I hit her I was full of joy, and she of sorrow, and if I missed her, then she was joyful, and I sorry.\" The judges were not satisfied with this answer, but gave him the reward he deserved.</string>
    <string name="story413text">There was once on a time a shepherd boy whose fame spread far and wide because of the wise answers which he gave to every question. The King of the country heard of it likewise, but did not believe it, and sent for the boy. Then he said to him: \"If thou canst give me an answer to three questions which I will ask thee, I will look on thee as my own child, and thou shall dwell with me in my royal palace.\" The boy said: \"What are the three questions?\" The King said: \"The first is, how many drops of water are there in the ocean?\" The shepherd boy answered: \"Lord King, if you will have all the rivers on earth dammed up so that not a single drop runs from them into the sea until I have counted it, I will tell you how many drops there are in the sea.\" The King said: \"The next question is, how many stars are there in the sky?\" The shepherd boy said: \"Give me a great sheet of white paper,\" and then he made so many fine points on it with a pen that they could scarcely be seen, and it was all but impossible to count them; any one who looked at them would have lost his sight. Then he said: \"There are as many stars in the sky as there are points on the paper; just count them.\" But no one was able to do it. The King said: \"The third question is, how many seconds of time are there in eternity.\" Then said the shepherd boy: \"In Lower Pomerania is the Diamond Mountain, which is two miles and a half high, two miles and a half wide, and two miles and a half in depth; every hundred years a little bird comes and sharpens its beak on it, and when the whole mountain is worn away by this, then the first second of eternity will be over.\"\n\nThe King said: \"Thou hast answered the three questions like a wise man, and shalt henceforth dwell with me in my royal palace, and I will regard thee as my own child.\"</string>
    <string name="story414text">There was once upon a time a King who had twelve daughters, each one more beautiful than the other. They all slept together in one chamber, in which their beds stood side by side, and every night when they were in them the King locked the door, and bolted it. But in the morning when he unlocked the door, he saw that their shoes were worn out with dancing, and no one could find out how that had come to pass. Then the King caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever could discover where they danced at night, should choose one of them for his wife and be King after his death, but that whosoever came forward and had not discovered it within three days and nights, should have forfeited his life. It was not long before a King\'s son presented himself, and offered to undertake the enterprise. He was well received, and in the evening was led into a room adjoining the princesses\' sleeping-chamber. His bed was placed there, and he was to observe where they went and danced, and in order that they might do nothing secretly or go away to some other place, the door of their room was left open.\nBut the eyelids of the prince grew heavy as lead, and he fell asleep, and when he awoke in the morning, all twelve had been to the dance, for their shoes were standing there with holes in the soles. On the second and third nights it fell out just the same, and then his head was struck off without mercy. Many others came after this and undertook the enterprise, but all forfeited their lives. Now it came to pass that a poor soldier, who had a wound, and could serve no longer, found himself on the road to the town where the King lived. There he met an old woman, who asked him where he was going. \"I hardly know myself,\" answered he, and added in jest, \"I had half a mind to discover where the princesses danced their shoes into holes, and thus become King.\" - \"That is not so difficult,\" said the old woman, \"you must not drink the wine which will be brought to you at night, and must pretend to be sound asleep.\" With that she gave him a little cloak, and said, \"If you put on that, you will be invisible, and then you can steal after the twelve.\" When the soldier had received this good advice, he went into the thing in earnest, took heart, went to the King, and announced himself as a suitor. He was as well received as the others, and royal garments were put upon him. He was conducted that evening at bed-time into the ante-chamber, and as he was about to go to bed, the eldest came and brought him a cup of wine, but he had tied a sponge under his chin, and let the wine run down into it, without drinking a drop. Then he lay down and when he had lain a while, he began to snore, as if in the deepest sleep. The twelve princesses heard that, and laughed, and the eldest said, \"He, too, might as well have saved his life.\" With that they got up, opened wardrobes, presses, cupboards, and brought out pretty dresses; dressed themselves before the mirrors, sprang about, and rejoiced at the prospect of the dance. Only the youngest said, \"I know not how it is; you are very happy, but I feel very strange; some misfortune is certainly about to befall us.\" - \"Thou art a goose, who art always frightened,\" said the eldest. \"Hast thou forgotten how many Kings\' sons have already come here in vain? I had hardly any need to give the soldier a sleeping-draught, in any case the clown would not have awakened.\" When they were all ready they looked carefully at the soldier, but he had closed his eyes and did not move or stir, so they felt themselves quite secure. The eldest then went to her bed and tapped it; it immediately sank into the earth, and one after the other they descended through the opening, the eldest going first. The soldier, who had watched everything, tarried no longer, put on his little cloak, and went down last with the youngest. Half-way down the steps, he just trod a little on her dress; she was terrified at that, and cried out, \"What is that? who is pulling my dress?\" - \"Don\'t be so silly!\" said the eldest, \"you have caught it on a nail.\" Then they went all the way down, and when they were at the bottom, they were standing in a wonderfully pretty avenue of trees, all the leaves of which were of silver, and shone and glistened. The soldier thought, \"I must carry a token away with me,\" and broke off a twig from one of them, on which the tree cracked with a loud report. The youngest cried out again. \"Something is wrong, did you hear the crack?\" But the eldest said, \"It is a gun fired for joy, because we have got rid of our prince so quickly.\" After that they came into an avenue where all the leaves were of gold, and lastly into a third where they were of bright diamonds; he broke off a twig from each, which made such a crack each time that the youngest started back in terror, but the eldest still maintained that they were salutes. They went on and came to a great lake whereon stood twelve little boats, and in every boat sat a handsome prince, all of whom were waiting for the twelve, and each took one of them with him, but the soldier seated himself by the youngest. Then her prince said, \"I can\'t tell why the boat is so much heavier to-day; I shall have to row with all my strength, if I am to get it across.\" - \"What should cause that,\" said the youngest, \"but the warm weather? I feel very warm too.\" On the opposite side of the lake stood a splendid, brightly-lit castle, from whence resounded the joyous music of trumpets and kettle-drums. They rowed over there, entered, and each prince danced with the girl he loved, but the soldier danced with them unseen, and when one of them had a cup of wine in her hand he drank it up, so that the cup was empty when she carried it to her mouth; the youngest was alarmed at this, but the eldest always made her be silent. They danced there till three o\'clock in the morning when all the shoes were danced into holes, and they were forced to leave off; the princes rowed them back again over the lake, and this time the soldier seated himself by the eldest. On the shore they took leave of their princes, and promised to return the following night. When they reached the stairs the soldier ran on in front and lay down in his bed, and when the twelve had come up slowly and wearily, he was already snoring so loudly that they could all hear him, and they said, \"So far as he is concerned, we are safe.\" They took off their beautiful dresses, laid them away, put the worn-out shoes under the bed, and lay down. Next morning the soldier was resolved not to speak, but to watch the wonderful goings on, and again went with them. Then everything was done just as it had been done the first time, and each time they danced until their shoes were worn to pieces. But the third time he took a cup away with him as a token. When the hour had arrived for him to give his answer, he took the three twigs and the cup, and went to the King, but the twelve stood behind the door, and listened for what he was going to say. When the King put the question, \"Where have my twelve daughters danced their shoes to pieces in the night?\" he answered, \"In an underground castle with twelve princes,\" and related how it had come to pass, and brought out the tokens. The King then summoned his daughters, and asked them if the soldier had told the truth, and when they saw that they were betrayed, and that falsehood would be of no avail, they were obliged to confess all. Thereupon the King asked which of them he would have to wife? He answered, \"I am no longer young, so give me the eldest.\" Then the wedding was celebrated on the self-same day, and the kingdom was promised him after the King\'s death. But the princes were bewitched for as many days as they had danced nights with the twelve.</string>
    <string name="story415text">There were once two brothers, the one rich, the other poor. The rich one, however, gave nothing to the poor one, and he gained a scanty living by trading in corn, and often did so badly that he had no bread for his wife and children. Once when he was wheeling a barrow through the forest he saw, on one side of him, a great, bare, naked-looking mountain, and as he had never seen it before, he stood still and stared at it with amazement.\nWhile he was thus standing he saw a twelve great, wild men coming towards him, and as he believed they were robbers he pushed his barrow into the thicket, climbed up a tree, and waited to see what would happen. The twelve men, however, went to the mountain and cried, \"Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open,\" and immediately the barren mountain opened down the middle, and the twelve went into it, and as soon as they were within, it shut. After a short time, however, it opened again, and the men came forth carrying heavy sacks on their shoulders, and when they were all once more in the daylight they said, \"Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, shut thyself;\" then the mountain closed together, and there was no longer any entrance to be seen to it, and the twelve went away.\n\nWhen they were quite out of sight the poor man got down from the tree, and was curious to know what really was secretly hidden in the mountain. So he went up to it and said, \"Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open,\" and the mountain opened to him also. The he went inside, and the whole mountain was a cavern full of silver and gold, and behind lay great piles of pearls and sparkling jewels, heaped up like corn. The poor man hardly knew what to do, and whether he might take any of these treasures for himself or not; but at last he filled his pockets with gold, but he left the pearls and precious stones where they were. When he came out again he also said, \"Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, shut thyself;\" and the mountain closed itself, and he went home with his barrow.\n\nAnd now he had no more cause for anxiety, but could buy bread for his wife and children with his gold, and wine into the bargain. He lived joyously and uprightly, gave help to the poor, and did good to every one. When, however, the money came to an end he went to his brother, borrowed a measure that held a bushel, and brought himself some more, but did not touch any of the most valuable things. When for the third time he wanted to fetch something, he again borrowed the measure of his brother. The rich man had, however, long been envious of his brother\'s possessions, and of the handsome way of living which he had set on foot, and could not understand from whence the riches came, and what his brother wanted with the measure. Then he thought of a cunning trick, and covered the bottom of the measure with pitch, and when he got the measure back a piece of money was sticking in it. He at once went to his brother and asked him, \"What hast thou been measuring in the bushel measure?\" - \"Corn and barley,\" said the other. Then he showed him the piece of money, and threatened that if he did not tell the truth he would accuse him before a court of justice. The poor man then told him everything, just as it happened. The rich man, however, ordered his carriage to be made ready, and drove away, resolved to use the opportunity better than his brother had done, and to bring back with him quite different treasures.\n\nWhen he came to the mountain he cried, \"Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open.\" The mountain opened, and he went inside it. There lay the treasures all before him, and for a long time he did not know which to clutch at first. At length he loaded himself with as many precious stones as he could carry. He wished to carry his burden outside, but, as his heart and soul were entirely full of the treasures, he had forgotten the name of the mountain, and cried, \"Simeli mountain, Simeli mountain, open.\" That, however, was not the right name, and the mountain never stirred, but remained shut. Then he was alarmed, but the longer he thought about it the more his thoughts confused themselves, and his treasures were no more of any use to him. In the evening the mountain opened, and the twelve robbers came in, and when they saw him they laughed, and cried out, \"Bird, have we caught thee at last! Didst thou think we had never noticed that thou hadst been in here twice? We could not catch thee then; this third time thou shalt not get out again!\" Then he cried, \"It was not I, it was my brother,\" but let him beg for his life and say what he would, they cut his head off.</string>
    <string name="story416text">In a certain country there was once great lamentation over a wild boar that laid waste the farmer\'s fields, killed the cattle, and ripped up people\'s bodies with his tusks. The King promised a large reward to anyone who would free the land from this plague; but the beast was so big and strong that no one dared to go near the forest in which it lived. At last the King gave notice that whosoever should capture or kill the wild boar should have his only daughter to wife.\n\nNow there lived in the country two brothers, sons of a poor man, who declared themselves willing to undertake the hazardous enterprise; the elder, who was crafty and shrewd, out of pride; the younger, who was innocent and simple, from a kind heart. The King said, \"In order that you may be the more sure of finding the beast, you must go into the forest from opposite sides.\" So the elder went in on the west side, and the younger on the east. When the younger had gone a short way, a little man stepped up to him. He held in his hand a black spear and said, \"I give you this spear because your heart is pure and good; with this you can boldly attack the wild boar, and it will do you no harm.\" He thanked the little man, shouldered the spear, and went on fearlessly. Before long he saw the beast, which rushed at him; but he held the spear towards it, and in its blind fury it ran so swiftly against it that its heart was cloven in twain. Then he took the monster on his back and went homewards with it to the King.\n\nAs he came out at the other side of the wood, there stood at the entrance a house where people were making merry with wine and dancing. His elder brother had gone in here, and, thinking that after all the boar would not run away from him, was going to drink until he felt brave. But when he saw his young brother coming out of the wood laden with his booty, his envious, evil heart gave him no peace. He called out to him, \"Come in, dear brother, rest and refresh yourself with a cup of wine.\" The youth, who suspected no evil, went in and told him about the good little man who had given him the spear wherewith he had slain the boar.\n\nThe elder brother kept him there until the evening, and then they went away together, and when in the darkness they came to a bridge over a brook, the elder brother let the other go first; and when he was half-way across he gave him such a blow from behind that he fell down dead. He buried him beneath the bridge, took the boar, and carried it to the King, pretending that he had killed it; whereupon he obtained the King\'s daughter in marriage. And when his younger brother did not come back he said, \"The boar must have killed him,\" and every one believed it.\n\nBut as nothing remains hidden from God, so this black deed also was to come to light. Years afterwards a shepherd was driving his herd across the bridge, and saw lying in the sand beneath, a snow-white little bone. He thought that it would make a good mouth-piece, so he clambered down, picked it up, and cut out of it a mouth-piece for his horn. But when he blew through it for the first time, to his great astonishment, the bone began of its own accord to sing:\n\n\"Ah, friend,\nThou blowest upon my bone!\nLong have I lain beside the water;\nMy brother slew me for the boar,\nAnd took for his wife\nThe King\'s young daughter.\"\n\n\"What a wonderful horn!\" said the shepherd; \"it sings by itself; I must take it to my lord the King.\" And when he came with it to the King the horn again began to sing its little song. The King understood it all, and caused the ground below the bridge to be dug up, and then the whole skeleton of the murdered man came to light. The wicked brother could not deny the deed, and was sewn up in a sack and drowned. But the bones of the murdered man were laid to rest in a beautiful tomb in the churchyard.</string>
    <string name="story417text">There was once on a time a man who was about to set out on a long journey, and on parting he asked his three daughters what he should bring back with him for them. Whereupon the eldest wished for pearls, the second wished for diamonds, but the third said, \"Dear father, I should like a singing, soaring lark.\" The father said, \"Yes, if I can get it, you shall have it,\" kissed all three, and set out. Now when the time had come for him to be on his way home again, he had brought pearls and diamonds for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for a singing, soaring lark for the youngest, and he was very unhappy about it, for she was his favorite child. Then his road lay through a forest, and in the midst of it was a splendid castle, and near the castle stood a tree, but quite on the top of the tree, he saw a singing, soaring lark. \"Aha, you come just at the right moment!\" he said, quite delighted, and called to his servant to climb up and catch the little creature. But as he approached the tree, a lion leapt from beneath it, shook himself, and roared till the leaves on the trees trembled. \"He who tries to steal my singing, soaring lark,\" he cried, \"will I devour.\" Then the man said, \"I did not know that the bird belonged to thee. I will make amends for the wrong I have done and ransom myself with a large sum of money, only spare my life.\" The lion said, \"Nothing can save thee, unless thou wilt promise to give me for mine own what first meets thee on thy return home; and if thou wilt do that, I will grant thee thy life, and thou shalt have the bird for thy daughter, into the bargain.\" But the man hesitated and said, \"That might be my youngest daughter, she loves me best, and always runs to meet me on my return home.\" The servant, however, was terrified and said, \"Why should your daughter be the very one to meet you, it might as easily be a cat, or dog?\" Then the man allowed himself to be over-persuaded, took the singing, soaring lark, and promised to give the lion whatsoever should first meet him on his return home.\nWhen he reached home and entered his house, the first who met him was no other than his youngest and dearest daughter, who came running up, kissed and embraced him, and when she saw that he had brought with him a singing, soaring lark, she was beside herself with joy. The father, however, could not rejoice, but began to weep, and said, \"My dearest child, I have bought the little bird dear. In return for it, I have been obliged to promise thee to a savage lion, and when he has thee he will tear thee in pieces and devour thee,\" and he told her all, just as it had happened, and begged her not to go there, come what might. But she consoled him and said, \"Dearest father, indeed your promise must be fulfilled. I will go thither and soften the lion, so that I may return to thee safely.\" Next morning she had the road pointed out to her, took leave, and went fearlessly out into the forest. The lion, however, was an enchanted prince and was by day a lion, and all his people were lions with him, but in the night they resumed their natural human shapes. On her arrival she was kindly received and led into the castle. When night came, the lion turned into a handsome man, and their wedding was celebrated with great magnificence. They lived happily together, remained awake at night, and slept in the daytime. One day he came and said, \"To-morrow there is a feast in thy father\'s house, because your eldest sister is to be married, and if thou art inclined to go there, my lions shall conduct thee.\" She said, \"Yes, I should very much like to see my father again,\" and went thither, accompanied by the lions. There was great joy when she arrived, for they had all believed that she had been torn in pieces by the lion, and had long ceased to live. But she told them what a handsome husband she had, and how well off she was, remained with them while the wedding-feast lasted, and then went back again to the forest. When the second daughter was about to be married, and she was again invited to the wedding, she said to the lion, \"This time I will not be alone, thou must come with me.\" The lion, however, said that it was too dangerous for him, for if when there a ray from a burning candle fell on him, he would be changed into a dove, and for seven years long would have to fly about with the doves. She said, \"Ah, but do come with me, I will take great care of thee, and guard thee from all light.\" So they went away together, and took with them their little child as well. She had a chamber built there, so strong and thick that no ray could pierce through it; in this he was to shut himself up when the candles were lit for the wedding-feast. But the door was made of green wood which warped and left a little crack which no one noticed. The wedding was celebrated with magnificence, but when the procession with all its candles and torches came back from church, and passed by this apartment, a ray about the bredth of a hair fell on the King\'s son, and when this ray touched him, he was transformed in an instant, and when she came in and looked for him, she did not see him, but a white dove was sitting there. The dove said to her, \"For seven years must I fly about the world, but at every seventh step that you take I will let fall a drop of red blood and a white feather, and these will show thee the way, and if thou followest the trace thou canst release me.\" Thereupon the dove flew out at the door, and she followed him, and at every seventh step a red drop of blood and a little white feather fell down and showed her the way.\n\nSo she went continually further and further in the wide world, never looking about her or resting, and the seven years were almost past; then she rejoiced and thought that they would soon be delivered, and yet they were so far from it! Once when they were thus moving onwards, no little feather and no drop of red blood fell, and when she raised her eyes the dove had disappeared. And as she thought to herself, \"In this no man can help thee,\" she climbed up to the sun, and said to him, \"Thou shinest into every crevice, and over every peak, hast thou not seen a white dove flying?\" - \"No,\" said the sun, \"I have seen none, but I present thee with a casket, open it when thou art in sorest need.\" Then she thanked the sun, and went on until evening came and the moon appeared; she then asked her, \"Thou shinest the whole night through, and on every field and forest, hast thou not seen a white dove flying?\" - \"No,\" said the moon, \"I have seen no dove, but here I give thee an egg, break it when thou art in great need.\" She thanked the moon, and went on until the night wind came up and blew on her, then she said to it, \"Thou blowest over every tree and under every leaf, hast thou not seen a white dove flying?\" - \"No,\" said the night wind, \"I have seen none, but I will ask the three other winds, perhaps they have seen it.\" The east wind and the west wind came, and had seen nothing, but the south wind said, \"I have seen the white dove, it has flown to the Red Sea, where it has become a lion again, for the seven years are over, and the lion is there fighting with a dragon; the dragon, however, is an enchanted princess.\" The night wind then said to her, \"I will advise thee; go to the Red Sea, on the right bank are some tall reeds, count them, break off the eleventh, and strike the dragon with it, then the lion will be able to subdue it, and both then will regain their human form. After that, look round and thou wilt see the griffin which is by the Red Sea; swing thyself, with thy beloved, on to his back, and the bird will carry you over the sea to your own home. Here is a nut for thee, when thou are above the center of the sea, let the nut fall, it will immediately shoot up, and a tall nut-tree will grow out of the water on which the griffin may rest; for if he cannot rest, he will not be strong enough to carry you across, and if thou forgettest to throw down the nut, he will let you fall into the sea.\"\n\nThen she went thither, and found everything as the night wind had said. She counted the reeds by the sea, and cut off the eleventh, struck the dragon therewith, whereupon the lion overcame it, and immediately both of them regained their human shapes. But when the princess, who had before been the dragon, was delivered from enchantment, she took the youth by the arm, seated herself on the griffin, and carried him off with her. There stood the poor maiden who had wandered so far and was again forsaken. She sat down and cried, but at last she took courage and said, \"Still I will go as far as the wind blows and as long as the cock crows, until I find him,\" and she went forth by long, long roads, until at last she came to the castle where both of them were living together; there she heard that soon a feast was to be held, in which they would celebrate their wedding, but she said, \"God still helps me,\" and opened the casket that the sun had given her. A dress lay therein as brilliant as the sun itself. So she took it out and put it on, and went up into the castle, and everyone, even the bride herself, looked at her with astonishment. The dress pleased the bride so well that she thought it might do for her wedding-dress, and asked if it was for sale? \"Not for money or land,\" answered she, \"but for flesh and blood.\" The bride asked her what she meant by that, so she said, \"Let me sleep a night in the chamber where the bridegroom sleeps.\" The bride would not, yet wanted very much to have the dress; at last she consented, but the page was to give the prince a sleeping-draught. When it was night, therefore, and the youth was already asleep, she was led into the chamber; she seated herself on the bed and said, \"I have followed after thee for seven years. I have been to the sun and the moon, and the four winds, and have enquired for thee, and have helped thee against the dragon; wilt thou, then quite forget me?\" But the prince slept so soundly that it only seemed to him as if the wind were whistling outside in the fir-trees. When therefore day broke, she was led out again, and had to give up the golden dress. And as that even had been of no avail, she was sad, went out into a meadow, sat down there, and wept. While she was sitting there, she thought of the egg which the moon had given her; she opened it, and there came out a clucking hen with twelve chickens all of gold, and they ran about chirping, and crept again under the old hen\'s wings; nothing more beautiful was ever seen in the world! Then she arose, and drove them through the meadow before her, until the bride looked out of the window. The little chickens pleased her so much that she immediately came down and asked if they were for sale. \"Not for money or land, but for flesh and blood; let me sleep another night in the chamber where the bridegroom sleeps.\" The bride said, \"Yes,\" intending to cheat her as on the former evening. But when the prince went to bed he asked the page what the murmuring and rustling in the night had been? On this the page told all; that he had been forced to give him a sleeping-draught, because a poor girl had slept secretly in the chamber, and that he was to give him another that night. The prince said, \"Pour out the draught by the bed-side.\" At night, she was again led in, and when she began to relate how ill all had fared with her, he immediately recognized his beloved wife by her voice, sprang up and cried, \"Now I really am released! I have been as it were in a dream, for the strange princess has bewitched me so that I have been compelled to forget thee, but God has delivered me from the spell at the right time.\" Then they both left the castle secretly in the night, for they feared the father of the princess, who was a sorcerer, and they seated themselves on the griffin which bore them across the Red Sea, and when they were in the midst of it, she let fall the nut. Immediately a tall nut-tree grew up, whereon the bird rested, and then carried them home, where they found their child, who had grown tall and beautiful, and they lived thenceforth happily until their death.</string>
    <string name="story418text">In former times there lived an aged Queen who was a sorceress, and her daughter was the most beautiful maiden under the sun. The old woman, however, had no other thought than how to lure mankind to destruction, and when a wooer appeared, she said that whosoever wished to have her daughter, must first perform a task, or die. Many had been dazzled by the daughter\'s beauty, and had actually risked this, but they never could accomplish what the old woman enjoined them to do, and then no mercy was shown; they had to kneel down, and their heads were struck off. A certain King\'s son who had also heard of the maiden\'s beauty, said to his father, \"Let me go there, I want to demand her in marriage.\" - \"Never,\" answered the King; \"if you were to go, it would be going to your death.\" On this the son lay down and was sick unto death, and for seven years he lay there, and no physician could heal him. When the father perceived that all hope was over, with a heavy heart he said to him, \"Go thither, and try your luck, for I know no other means of curing you.\" When the son heard that, he rose from his bed and was well again, and joyfully set out on his way.\n\nAnd it came to pass that as he was riding across a heath, he saw from afar something like a great heap of hay lying on the ground, and when he drew nearer, he could see that it was the stomach of a man, who had laid himself down there, but the stomach looked like a small mountain. When the fat man saw the traveller, he stood up and said, \"If you are in need of any one, take me into your service.\" The prince answered, \"What can I do with such a great big man?\" - \"Oh,\" said the Stout One, \"this is nothing, when I stretch myself out well, I am three thousand times fatter.\" - \"If that\'s the case,\" said the prince, \"I can make use of thee, come with me.\" So the Stout One followed the prince, and after a while they found another man who was lying on the ground with his ear laid to the turf. \"What art thou doing there?\" asked the King\'s son. \"I am listening,\" replied the man. \"What art thou listening to so attentively?\" - \"I am listening to what is just going on in the world, for nothing escapes my ears; I even hear the grass growing.\" - \"Tell me,\" said the prince, \"what thou hearest at the court of the old Queen who has the beautiful daughter.\" Then he answered, \"I hear the whizzing of the sword that is striking off a wooer\'s head.\" The King\'s son said, \"I can make use of thee, come with me.\" They went onwards, and then saw a pair of feet lying and part of a pair of legs, but could not see the rest of the body. When they had walked on for a great distance, they came to the body, and at last to the head also. \"Why,\" said the prince, \"what a tall rascal thou art!\" - \"Oh,\" replied the Tall One, \"that is nothing at all yet; when I really stretch out my limbs, I am three thousand times as tall, and taller than the highest mountain on earth. I will gladly enter your service, if you will take me.\" - \"Come with me,\" said the prince, \"I can make use of thee.\" They went onwards and found a man sitting by the road who had bound up his eyes. The prince said to him, \"Hast thou weak eyes, that thou canst not look at the light?\" - \"No,\" replied the man, \"but I must not remove the bandage, for whatsoever I look at with my eyes, splits to pieces, my glance is so powerful. If you can use that, I shall be glad to serve you.\" - \"Come with me,\" replied the King\'s son, \"I can make use of thee.\" They journeyed onwards and found a man who was lying in the hot sunshine, trembling and shivering all over his body, so that not a limb was still. \"How canst thou shiver when the sun is shining so warm?\" said the King\'s son. \"Alack,\" replied the man, \"I am of quite a different nature. The hotter it is, the colder I am, and the frost pierces through all my bones; and the colder it is, the hotter I am. In the midst of ice, I cannot endure the heat, nor in the midst of fire, the cold.\" - \"Thou art a strange fellow,\" said the prince, \"but if thou wilt enter my service, follow me.\" They travelled onwards, and saw a man standing who made a long neck and looked about him, and could see over all the mountains. \"What art thou looking at so eagerly?\" said the King\'s son. The man replied, \"I have such sharp eyes that I can see into every forest and field, and hill and valley, all over the world.\" The prince said, \"Come with me if thou wilt, for I am still in want of such an one.\"\n\nAnd now the King\'s son and his six servants came to the town where the aged Queen dwelt. He did not tell her who he was, but said, \"If you will give me your beautiful daughter, I will perform any task you set me.\" The sorceress was delighted to get such a handsome youth as this into her net, and said, \"I will set thee three tasks, and if thou art able to perform them all, thou shalt be husband and master of my daughter.\" - \"What is the first to be?\" - \"Thou shalt fetch me my ring which I have dropped into the Red Sea.\" So the King\'s son went home to his servants and said, \"The first task is not easy. A ring is to be got out of the Red Sea. Come, find some way of doing it.\" Then the man with the sharp sight said, \"I will see where it is lying,\" and looked down into the water and said, \"It is sticking there, on a pointed stone.\" The Tall One carried them thither, and said, \"I would soon get it out, if I could only see it.\" - \"Oh, is that all!\" cried the Stout One, and lay down and put his mouth to the water, on which all the waves fell into it just as if it had been a whirlpool, and he drank up the whole sea till it was as dry as a meadow. The Tall One stooped down a little, and brought out the ring with his hand. Then the King\'s son rejoiced when he had the ring, and took it to the old Queen. She was astonished, and said, \"Yes, it is the right ring. Thou hast safely performed the first task, but now comes the second. Dost thou see the meadow in front of my palace? Three hundred fat oxen are feeding there, and these must thou eat, skin, hair, bones, horns and all, and down below in my cellar lie three hundred casks of wine, and these thou must drink up as well, and if one hair of the oxen, or one little drop of the wine is left, thy life will be forfeited to me.\" - \"May I invite no guests to this repast?\" inquired the prince, \"no dinner is good without some company.\" The old woman laughed maliciously, and replied, \"Thou mayst invite one for the sake of companionship, but no more.\"\n\nThe King\'s son went to his servants and said to the Stout One, \"Thou shalt be my guest to-day, and shalt eat thy fill.\" Hereupon the Stout One stretched himself out and ate the three hundred oxen without leaving one single hair, and then he asked if he was to have nothing but his breakfast. He drank the wine straight from the casks without feeling any need of a glass, and he licked the last drop from his finger-nails. When the meal was over, the prince went to the old woman, and told her that the second task also was performed. She wondered at this and said, \"No one has ever done so much before, but one task still remains,\" and she thought to herself, \"Thou shalt not escape me, and wilt not keep thy head on thy shoulders! This night,\" said she, \"I will bring my daughter to thee in thy chamber, and thou shalt put thine arms round her, but when you are sitting there together, beware of falling asleep. When twelve o\'clock is striking, I will come, and if she is then no longer in thine arms, thou art lost.\" The prince thought, \"The task is easy, I will most certainly keep my eyes open.\" Nevertheless he called his servants, told them what the old woman had said, and remarked, \"Who knows what treachery lurks behind this? Foresight is a good thing keep watch, and take care that the maiden does not go out of my room again.\" When night fell, the old woman came with her daughter, and gave her into the princes\'s arms, and then the Tall One wound himself round the two in a circle, and the Stout One placed himself by the door, so that no living creature could enter. There the two sat, and the maiden spake never a word, but the moon shone through the window on her face, and the prince could behold her wondrous beauty. He did nothing but gaze at her, and was filled with love and happiness, and his eyes never felt weary. This lasted until eleven o\'clock, when the old woman cast such a spell over all of them that they fell asleep, and at the self-same moment the maiden was carried away.\n\nThen they all slept soundly until a quarter to twelve, when the magic lost its power, and all awoke again. \"Oh, misery and misfortune!\" cried the prince, \"now I am lost!\" The faithful servants also began to lament, but the Listener said, \"Be quiet, I want to listen.\" Then he listened for an instant and said, \"She is on a rock, three hundred leagues from hence, bewailing her fate. Thou alone, Tall One, canst help her; if thou wilt stand up, thou wilt be there in a couple of steps.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the Tall One, \"but the one with the sharp eyes must go with me, that we may destroy the rock.\" Then the Tall One took the one with bandaged eyes on his back, and in the twinkling of an eye they were on the enchanted rock. The Tall One immediately took the bandage from the other\'s eyes, and he did but look round, and the rock shivered into a thousand pieces. Then the Tall One took the maiden in his arms, carried her back in a second, then fetched his companion with the same rapidity, and before it struck twelve they were all sitting as they had sat before, quite merrily and happily. When twelve struck, the aged sorceress came stealing in with a malicious face, which seemed to say, \"Now he is mine!\" for she believed that her daughter was on the rock three hundred leagues off.\" But when she saw her in the prince\'s arms, she was alarmed, and said, \"Here is one who knows more than I do!\" She dared not make any opposition, and was forced to give him her daughter. But she whispered in her ear, \"It is a disgrace to thee to have to obey common people, and that thou art not allowed to choose a husband to thine own liking.\"\n\nOn this the proud heart of the maiden was filled with anger, and she meditated revenge. Next morning she caused three hundred great bundles of wood to be got together, and said to the prince that though the three tasks were performed, she would still not be his wife until some one was ready to seat himself in the midst of the wood, and bear the fire. She thought that none of his servants would let themselves be burnt for him, and that out of love for her, he himself would place himself upon it, and then she would be free. But the servants said, \"Every one of us has done something except the Frosty One, he must set to work,\" and they put him in the middle of the pile, and set fire to it. Then the fire began to burn, and burnt for three days until all the wood was consumed, and when the flames had burnt out, the Frosty One was standing amid the ashes, trembling like an aspen leaf, and saying, \"I never felt such a frost during the whole course of my life; if it had lasted much longer, I should have been benumbed!\"\n\nAs no other pretext was to be found, the beautiful maiden was now forced to take the unknown youth as a husband. But when they drove away to church, the old woman said, \"I cannot endure the disgrace,\" and sent her warriors after them with orders to cut down all who opposed them, and bring back her daughter. But the Listener had sharpened his ears, and heard the secret discourse of the old woman. \"What shall we do?\" said he to the Stout One. But he knew what to do, and spat out once or twice behind the carriage some of the sea-water which he had drunk, and a great sea arose in which the warriors were caught and drowned. When the sorceress perceived that, she sent her mailed knights; but the Listener heard the rattling of their armour, and undid the bandage from one eye of Sharp-eyes, who looked for a while rather fixedly at the enemy\'s troops, on which they all sprang to pieces like glass. Then the youth and the maiden went on their way undisturbed, and when the two had been blessed in church, the six servants took leave, and said to their master, \"Your wishes are now satisfied, you need us no longer, we will go our way and seek our fortunes.\"\n\nHalf a league from the palace of the prince\'s father was a village near which a swineherd tended his herd, and when they came thither the prince said to his wife, \"Do you know who I really am? I am no prince, but a herder of swine, and the man who is there with that herd, is my father. We two shall have to set to work also, and help him.\" Then he alighted with her at the inn, and secretly told the innkeepers to take away her royal apparel during the night. So when she awoke in the morning, she had nothing to put on, and the innkeeper\'s wife gave her an old gown and a pair of worsted stockings, and at the same time seemed to consider it a great present, and said, \"If it were not for the sake of your husband I should have given you nothing at all!\" Then the princess believed that he really was a swineherd, and tended the herd with him, and thought to herself, \"I have deserved this for my haughtiness and pride.\" This lasted for a week, and then she could endure it no longer, for she had sores on her feet. And now came a couple of people who asked if she knew who her husband was. \"Yes,\" she answered, \"he is a swineherd, and has just gone out with cords and ropes to try to drive a little bargain.\" But they said, \"Just come with us, and we will take you to him,\" and they took her up to the palace, and when she entered the hall, there stood her husband in kingly raiment. But she did not recognize him until he took her in his arms, kissed her, and said, \"I suffered much for thee and now thou, too, hast had to suffer for me.\" And then the wedding was celebrated, and he who has told you all this, wishes that he, too, had been present at it.</string>
    <string name="story419text">There was once a man who was a Jack-of-all-trades; he had served in the war, and had been brave and bold, but at the end of it he was sent about his business, with three farthings and his discharge. \"I am not going to stand this,\" said he; \"wait till I find the right man to help me, and the king shall give me all the treasures of his kingdom before he has done with me.\" Then, full of wrath, he went into the forest, and he saw one standing there by six trees which he had rooted up as if they had been stalks of corn. And he said to him, \"Will you be my man, and come along with me?\" - \"All right,\" answered he; \"I must just take this bit of wood home to my father and mother.\" And taking one of the trees, he bound it round the other five, and putting the faggot on his shoulder, he carried it off; then soon coming back, he went along with his leader, who said, \"Two such as we can stand against the whole world.\"\n\nAnd when they had gone on a little while, they came to a huntsman who was kneeling on one knee and taking careful aim with his rifle. \"Huntsman,\" said the leader, \"what are you aiming at?\" - \"Two miles from here,\" answered he, \"there sits a fly on the bough of an oak-tree, I mean to put a bullet into its left eye.\" - \"Oh, come along with me,\" said the leader; \"three of us together can stand against the world.\" The huntsman was quite willing to go with him, and so they went on till they came to seven windmills, whose sails were going round briskly, and yet there was no wind blowing from any quarter, and not a leaf stirred. \"Well,\" said the leader, \"I cannot think what ails the windmills, turning without wind,\" and he went on with his followers about two miles farther, and then they came to a man sitting up in a tree, holding one nostril and blowing with the other. \"Now then,\" said the leader, \"what are you doing up there?\" - \"Two miles from here,\" answered he, \"there are seven windmills; I am blowing, and they are going round.\" - \"Oh, go with me,\" cried the leader, \"four of us together can stand against the world.\"\n\nSo the blower got down and went with them, and after a time they came to a man standing on one leg, and the other had been taken off and was lying near him. \"You seem to have got a handy way of resting yourself,\" said the leader to the man. \"I am a runner,\" answered he, \"and in order to keep myself from going too fast I have taken off a leg, for when I run with both, I go faster than a bird can fly.\" - \"Oh, go with me,\" cried the leader, \"five of us together may well stand against the world.\"\n\nSo he went with them all together, and it was not long before they met a man with a little hat on, and he wore it just over one ear. \"Manners! manners!\" said the leader; \"with your hat like that, you look like a jack-fool.\" - \"I dare not put it straight,\" answered the other; \"if I did, there would be such a terrible frost that the very birds would be frozen and fall dead from the sky to the ground.\" - \"Oh, come with me,\" said the leader; \"we six together may well stand against the whole world.\"\n\nSo the six went on until they came to a town where the king had caused it to be made known that whoever would run a race with his daughter and win it might become her husband, but that whoever lost must lose his head into the bargain. And the leader came forward and said one of his men should run for him. \"Then,\" said the king, \"his life too must be put in pledge, and if he fails, his head and yours too must fall.\" When this was quite settled and agreed upon, the leader called the runner, and strapped his second leg on to him. \"Now, look out,\" said he, \"and take care that we win.\" It had been agreed that the one who should bring water first from a far distant brook should be accounted winner. Now the king\'s daughter and the runner each took a pitcher, and they started both at the same time; but in one moment, when the king\'s daughter had gone but a very little way, the runner was out of sight, for his running was as if the wind rushed by. In a short time he reached the brook, filled his pitcher full of water, and turned back again. About half-way home, however, he was overcome with weariness, and setting down his pitcher, he lay down on the ground to sleep. But in order to awaken soon again by not lying too soft he had taken a horse\'s skull which lay near and placed it under his head for a pillow. In the meanwhile the king\'s daughter, who really was a good runner, good enough to beat an ordinary man, had reached the brook, and filled her pitcher, and was hastening with it back again, when she saw the runner lying asleep. \"The day is mine,\" said she with much joy, and she emptied his pitcher and hastened on. And now all had been lost but for the huntsman who was standing on the castle wall, and with his keen eyes saw all that happened. \"We must not be outdone by the king\'s daughter,\" said he, and he loaded his rifle and took so good an aim that he shot the horse\'s skull from under the runner\'s head without doing him any harm. And the runner awoke and jumped up, and saw his pitcher standing empty and the king\'s daughter far on her way home. But, not losing courage, he ran swiftly to the brook, filled it again with water, and for all that, he got home ten minutes before the king\'s daughter. \"Look you,\" said he; \"this is the first time I have really stretched my legs; before it was not worth the name of running.\" The king was vexed, and his daughter yet more so, that she should be beaten by a discharged common soldier; and they took counsel together how they might rid themselves of him and of his companions at the same time. \"I have a plan,\" said the king; \"do not fear but that we shall be quit of them for ever.\" Then he went out to the men and bade them to feast and be merry and eat and drink; and he led them into a room, which had a floor of iron, and the doors were iron, the windows had iron frames and bolts; in the room was a table set out with costly food. \"Now, go in there and make yourselves comfortable,\" said the king. And when they had gone in, he had the door locked and bolted. Then he called the cook, and told him to make a big fire underneath the room, so that the iron floor of it should be red hot. And the cook did so, and the six men began to feel the room growing very warm, by reason, as they thought at first, of the good dinner; but as the heat grew greater and greater, and they found the doors and windows fastened, they began to think it was an evil plan of the king\'s to suffocate them. \"He shall not succeed, however,\" said the man with the little hat; \"I will bring on a frost that shall make the fire feel ashamed of itself, and creep out of the way.\" So he set his hat straight on his head, and immediately there came such a frost that all the heat passed away and the food froze in the dishes. After an hour or two had passed, and the king thought they must have all perished in the heat, he caused the door to be opened, and went himself to see how they fared. And when the door flew back, there they were all six quite safe and sound, and they said they were quite ready to come out, so that they might warm themselves, for the great cold of that room had caused the food to freeze in the dishes. Full of wrath, the king went to the cook and scolded him, and asked why he had not done as he was ordered. \"It is hot enough there: you may see for yourself,\" answered the cook. And the king looked and saw an immense fire burning underneath the room of iron, and he began to think that the six men were not to be got rid of in that way.\n\nAnd he thought of a new plan by which it might be managed, so he sent for the leader and said to him, \"If you will give up your right to my daughter, and take gold instead, you may have as much as you like.\" - \"Certainly, my lord king,\" answered the man; \"let me have as much gold as my servant can carry, and I give up all claim to your daughter.\" And the king agreed that he should come again in a fortnight to fetch the gold. The man then called together all the tailors in the kingdom, and set them to work to make a sack, and it took them a fortnight. And when it was ready, the strong man who had been found rooting up trees took it on his shoulder, and went to the king. \"Who is this immense fellow carrying on his shoulder a bundle of stuff as big as a house?\" cried the king, terrified to think how much gold he would carry off. And a ton of gold was dragged in by sixteen strong men, but he put it all into the sack with one hand, saying, \"Why don\'t you bring some more? this hardly covers the bottom!\" So the king bade them fetch by degrees the whole of his treasure, and even then the sack was not half full. \"Bring more!\" cried the man; \"these few scraps go no way at all!\" Then at last seven thousand waggons laden with gold collected through the whole kingdom were driven up; and he threw them in his sack, oxen and all. \"I will not look too closely,\" said he, \"but take what 1 can get, so long as the sack is full.\" And when all was put in there was still plenty of room. \"I must make an end of this,\" he said; \"if it is not full, it is so much the easier to tie up.\" And he hoisted it on his back, and went off with his comrades. When the king saw all the wealth of his realm carried off by a single man he was full of wrath, and he bade his cavalry mount, and follow after the six men, and take the sack away from the strong man. Two regiments were soon up to them, and called them to consider themselves prisoners, and to deliver up the sack, or be cut in pieces. \"Prisoners, say you?\" said the man who could blow, \"suppose you first have a little dance together in the air,\" and holding one nostril, and blowing through the other, he sent the regiments flying head over heels, over the hills and far away. But a sergeant who had nine wounds and was a brave fellow, begged not to be put to so much shame. And the blower let him down easily, so that he came to no harm, and he bade him go to the king and tell him that whatever regiments he liked to send more should be blown away just the same. And the king, when he got the message, said, \"Let the fellows be; they have some right on their side.\"\n\nSo the six comrades carried home their treasure, divided it among them, and lived contented till they died.</string>
    <string name="story420text">Once on a time a king was hunting in a great wood, and he pursued a wild animal so eagerly that none of his people could follow him. When evening came he stood still, and looking round him he found that he had lost his way; and seeking a path, he found none. Then all at once he saw an old woman with a nodding head coming up to him; and it was a witch.\n\n\"My good woman,\" said he, \"can you show me the way out of the wood?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, my lord king,\" answered she, \"certainly I can; but I must make a condition, and if you do not fulfil it, you will never get out of the wood again, but die there of hunger.\"\n\n\"What is the condition?\" asked the king.\n\n\"I have a daughter,\" said the old woman, \"who is as fair as any in the world, and if you will take her for your bride, and make her queen, I will show you the way out of the wood.\"\n\nThe king consented, because of the difficulty he was in, and the old woman led him into her little house, and there her daughter was sitting by the fire. She received the king just as if she had been expecting him, and though he saw that she was very beautiful, she did not please him, and he could not look at her without an inward shudder. Nevertheless, he took the maiden before him on his horse, and the old woman showed him the way, and soon he was in his royal castle again, where the wedding was held.\n\nThe king had been married before, and his first wife had left seven children, six boys and one girl, whom he loved better than all the world, and as he was afraid the step-mother might not behave well to them, and perhaps would do them some mischief, he took them to a lonely castle standing in the middle of a wood. There they remained hidden, for the road to it was so hard to find that the king himself could not have found it, had it not been for a clew of yarn, possessing wonderful properties, that a wise woman had given him; when he threw it down before him, it unrolled itself and showed him the way.\n\nAnd the king went so often to see his dear children, that the queen was displeased at his absence; and she became curious and wanted to know what he went out into the wood for so often alone. She bribed his servants with much money, and they showed her the secret, and told her of the clew of yam, which alone could point out the way; then she gave herself no rest until she had found out where the king kept the clew, and then she made some little white silk shirts, and sewed a charm in each, as she had learned witchcraft of her mother. And once when the king had ridden, to the hunt, she took the little shirts and went into the wood, and the clew of yarn showed her the way. The children seeing some one in the distance, thought it was their dear father coming to see them, and came jumping for joy to meet him. Then the wicked queen threw over each one of the little shirts, and as soon as the shirts touched their bodies, they were changed into swans, and flew away through the wood. So the queen went home very pleased to think she had got rid of her stepchildren; but the maiden had not run out with her brothers, and so the queen knew nothing about her. The next day the king went to see his children, but he found nobody but his daughter.\n\n\"Where are thy brothers?\" asked the king.\n\n\"Ah, dear father,\" answered she, \"they are gone away and have left me behind,\" and then she told him how she had seen from her window her brothers in the guise of swans fly away through the wood, and she showed him the feathers which they had let fall in the courtyard, and which she had picked up. The king was grieved, but he never dreamt that it was the queen who had done this wicked deed, and as he feared lest the maiden also should be stolen away from him, he wished to take her away with him. But she was afraid of the step-mother, and begged the king to let her remain one more night in the castle in the wood.\n\nThen she said to herself, \"I must stay here no longer, but go and seek for my brothers.\" And when the night came, she fled away and went straight into the wood. She went on all that night and the next day, until she could go no longer for weariness. At last she saw a rude hut, and she went in and found a room with six little beds in it; she did not dare to lie down in one, but she crept under one and lay on the hard boards and wished for night. When it was near the time of sun-setting she heard a rustling sound, and saw six swans come flying in at the window. They alighted on the ground, and blew at one another until they had blown all their feathers off, and then they stripped off their swan-skin as if it had been a shirt. And the maiden looked at them and knew them for her brothers, and was very glad, and crept from under the bed. The brothers were not less glad when their sister appeared, but their joy did not last long.\n\n\"You must not stay here,\" said they to her; \"this is a robbers\' haunt, and if they were to come and find you here, they would kill you.\"\n\n\"And cannot you defend me?\" asked the little sister.\n\n\"No,\" answered they, \"for we can only get rid of our swan-skins and keep our human shape every evening for a quarter of an hour, but after that we must be changed again into swans.\" Their sister wept at hearing this, and said, \"Can nothing be done to set you free?\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" answered they, \"the work would be too hard for you. For six whole years you would be obliged never to speak or laugh, and make during that time six little shirts out of aster-flowers. If you were to let fall a single word before the work was ended, all would be of no good.\" And just as the brothers had finished telling her this, the quarter of an hour came to an end, and they changed into swans and flew out of the window.\n\nBut the maiden made up her mind to set her brothers free, even though it should cost her her life. She left the hut, and going into the middle of the wood, she climbed a tree, and there passed the night. The next morning she set to work and gathered asters and began sewing them together: as for speaking, there was no one to speak to, and as for laughing, she had no mind to it; so she sat on and looked at nothing but her work. When she had been going on like this for a long time, it happened that the king of that country went a-hunting in the wood, and some of his huntsmen came up to the tree in which the maiden sat. They called out to her, saying, \"Who art thou?\" But she gave no answer. \"Come down,\" cried they; \"we will do thee no harm.\" But she only shook her head. And when they tormented her further with questions she threw down to them her gold necklace, hoping they would be content with that. But they would not leave off, so she threw down to them her girdle, and when that was no good, her garters, and one after another everything she had on and could possibly spare, until she had nothing left but her smock. But all was no good, the huntsmen would not be put off any longer, and they climbed the tree, carried the maiden off, and brought her to the king.\n\nThe king asked, \"Who art thou? What wert thou doing in the tree?\" But she answered nothing. He spoke to her in all the languages he knew, but she remained dumb: but, being very beautiful, the king inclined to her, and he felt a great love rise up in his heart towards her; and casting his mantle round her, he put her before him on his horse and brought her to his castle. Then he caused rich clothing to be put upon her, and her beauty shone as bright as the morning, but no word would she utter. He seated her by his side at table, and her modesty and gentle mien so pleased him, that he said, \"This maiden I choose for wife, and no other in all the world,\" and accordingly after a few days they were married.\n\nBut the king had a wicked mother, who was displeased with the marriage, and spoke ill of the young queen. \"Who knows where the maid can have come from?\" said she, \"and not able to speak a word! She is not worthy of a king!\" After a year had passed, and the queen brought her first child into the world, the old woman carried it away, and marked the queen\'s mouth with blood as she lay sleeping. Then she went to the king and declared that his wife was an eater of human flesh. The king would not believe such a thing, and ordered that no one should do her any harm. And the queen went on quietly sewing the shirts and caring for nothing else. The next time that a fine boy was born, the wicked step-mother used the same deceit, but the king would give no credence to her words, for he said, \"She is too tender and good to do any such thing, and if she were only not dumb, and could justify herself, then her innocence would be as clear as day.\" When for the third time the old woman stole away the new-born child and accused the queen, who was unable to say a word in her defence, the king could do no other but give her up to justice, and she was sentenced to suffer death by fire.\n\nThe day on which her sentence was to be carried out was the very last one of the sixth year of the years during which she had neither spoken nor laughed, to free her dear brothers from the evil spell. The six shirts were ready, all except one which wanted the left sleeve. And when she was led to the pile of wood, she carried the six shirts on her arm, and when she mounted the pile and the fire was about to be kindled, all at once she cried out aloud, for there were six swans coming flying through the air; and she saw that her deliverance was near, and her heart beat for joy.\n\nThe swans came close up to her with rushing wings, and stooped round her, so that she could throw the shirts over them; and when that had been done the swanskins fell off them, and her brothers stood before her in their own bodies quite safe and sound; but as one shirt wanted the left sleeve, so the youngest brother had a swan\'s wing instead of a left arm. They embraced and kissed each other, and the queen went up to the king, who looked on full of astonishment, and began to speak to him and to say, \"Dearest husband, now I may dare to speak and tell you that I am innocent, and have been falsely accused,\" and she related to him the treachery of the step-mother, who had taken away the three children and hidden them. And she was reconciled to the king with great joy, and the wicked step-mother was bound to the stake on the pile of wood and burnt to ashes. And the king and queen lived many years with their six brothers in peace and joy.\n</string>
    <string name="story421text">There was once a young fellow who had learnt the trade of locksmith, and told his father he would now go out into the world and seek his fortune. \"Very well,\" said the father, \"I am quite content with that,\" and gave him some money for his journey. So he travelled about and looked for work. After a time he resolved not to follow the trade of locksmith any more, for he no longer liked it, but he took a fancy for hunting. Then there met him in his rambles a huntsman dressed in green, who asked whence he came and whither he was going? The youth said he was a locksmith\'s apprentice, but that the trade no longer pleased him, and he had a liking for huntsmanship, would he teach it to him? \"Oh, yes,\" said the huntsman, \"if thou wilt go with me.\" Then the young fellow went with him, bound himself to him for some years, and learnt the art of hunting. After this he wished to try his luck elsewhere, and the huntsman gave him nothing in the way of payment but an air-gun, which had, however, this property, that it hit its mark without fail whenever he shot with it. Then he set out and found himself in a very large forest, which he could not get to the end of in one day. When evening came he seated himself in a high tree in order to escape from the wild beasts. Towards midnight, it seemed to him as if a tiny little light glimmered in the distance. Then he looked down through the branches towards it, and kept well in his mind where it was. But in the first place he took off his hat and threw it down in the direction of the light, so that he might go to the hat as a mark when he had descended. Then he got down and went to his hat, put it on again and went straight forwards. The farther he went, the larger the light grew, and when he got close to it he saw that it was an enormous fire, and that three giants were sitting by it, who had an ox on the spit, and were roasting it. Presently one of them said, \"I must just taste if the meat will soon be fit to eat,\" and pulled a piece off, and was about to put it in his mouth when the huntsman shot it out of his hand. \"Well, really,\" said the giant, \"if the wind has not blown the bit out of my hand!\" and helped himself to another. But when he was just about to bite into it, the huntsman again shot it away from him. On this the giant gave the one who was sitting next him a box on the ear, and cried angrily, Why art thou snatching my piece away from me?\" - \"I have not snatched it away,\" said the other, \"a sharpshooter must have shot it away from thee.\" The giant took another piece, but could not, however, keep it in his hand, for the huntsman shot it out. Then the giant said, \"That must be a good shot to shoot the bit out of one\'s very mouth, such an one would be useful to us.\" And he cried aloud, \"Come here, thou sharpshooter, seat thyself at the fire beside us and eat thy fill, we will not hurt thee; but if thou wilt not come, and we have to bring thee by force, thou art a lost man!\" On this the youth went up to them and told them he was a skilled huntsman, and that whatever he aimed at with his gun, he was certain to hit. Then they said if he would go with them he should be well treated, and they told him that outside the forest there was a great lake, behind which stood a tower, and in the tower was imprisoned a lovely princess, whom they wished very much to carry off. \"Yes,\" said he, \"I will soon get her for you.\" Then they added, \"But there is still something else, there is a tiny little dog, which begins to bark directly any one goes near, and as soon as it barks every one in the royal palace wakens up, and for this reason we cannot get there; canst thou undertake to shoot it dead?\" - \"Yes,\" said he, \"that will be a little bit of fun for me.\" After this he got into a boat and rowed over the lake, and as soon as he landed, the little dog came running out, and was about to bark, but the huntsman took his air-gun and shot it dead. When the giants saw that, they rejoiced, and thought they already had the King\'s daughter safe, but the huntsman wished first to see how matters stood, and told them that they must stay outside until he called them. Then he went into the castle, and all was perfectly quiet within, and every one was asleep. When he opened the door of the first room, a sword was hanging on the wall which was made of pure silver, and there was a golden star on it, and the name of the King, and on a table near it lay a sealed letter which he broke open, and inside it was written that whosoever had the sword could kill everything which opposed him. So he took the sword from the wall, hung it at his side and went onwards: then he entered the room where the King\'s daughter was lying sleeping, and she was so beautiful that he stood still and, holding his breath, looked at her. He thought to himself, \"How can I give an innocent maiden into the power of the wild giants, who have evil in their minds?\" He looked about further, and under the bed stood a pair of slippers, on the right one was her father\'s name with a star, and on the left her own name with a star. She wore also a great neck-kerchief of silk embroidered with gold, and on the right side was her father\'s name, and on the left her own, all in golden letters. Then the huntsman took a pair of scissors and cut the right corner off, and put it in his knapsack, and then he also took the right slipper with the King\'s name, and thrust that in. Now the maiden still lay sleeping, and she was quite sewn into her night-dress, and he cut a morsel from this also, and thrust it in with the rest, but he did all without touching her. Then he went forth and left her lying asleep undisturbed, and when he came to the gate again, the giants were still standing outside waiting for him, and expecting that he was bringing the princess. But he cried to them that they were to come in, for the maiden was already in their power, that he could not open the gate to them, but there was a hole through which they must creep. Then the first approached, and the huntsman wound the giant\'s hair round his hand, pulled the head in, and cut it off at one stroke with his sword, and then drew the rest of him in. He called to the second and cut his head off likewise, and then he killed the third also, and he was well pleased that he had freed the beautiful maiden from her enemies, and he cut out their tongues and put them in his knapsack. Then thought he, \"I will go home to my father and let him see what I have already done, and afterwards I will travel about the world; the luck which God is pleased to grant me will easily find me.\"\nBut when the King in the castle awoke, he saw the three giants lying there dead. So he went into the sleeping-room of his daughter, awoke her, and asked who could have killed the giants? Then said she, \"Dear father, I know not, I have been asleep.\" But when she arose and would have put on her slippers, the right one was gone, and when she looked at her neck-kerchief it was cut, and the right corner was missing, and when she looked at her night-dress a piece was cut out of it. The King summoned his whole court together, soldiers and every one else who was there, and asked who had set his daughter at liberty, and killed the giants? Now it happened that he had a captain, who was one-eyed and a hideous man, and he said that he had done it. Then the old King said that as he had accomplished this, he should marry his daughter. But the maiden said, \"Rather than marry him, dear father, I will go away into the world as far as my legs can carry me.\" But the King said that if she would not marry him she should take off her royal garments and wear peasant\'s clothing, and go forth, and that she should go to a potter, and begin a trade in earthen vessels. So she put off her royal apparel, and went to a potter and borrowed crockery enough for a stall, and she promised him also that if she had sold it by the evening, she would pay for it. Then the King said she was to seat herself in a corner with it and sell it, and he arranged with some peasants to drive over it with their carts, so that everything should be broken into a thousand pieces. When therefore the King\'s daughter had placed her stall in the street, by came the carts, and broke all she had into tiny fragments. She began to weep and said, \"Alas, how shall I ever pay for the pots now?\" The King had, however, wished by this to force her to marry the captain; but instead of that, she again went to the potter, and asked him if he would lend to her once more. He said, \"No,\" she must first pay for the things she had already had. Then she went to her father and cried and lamented, and said she would go forth into the world. Then said he, \"I will have a little hut built for thee in the forest outside, and in it thou shalt stay all thy life long and cook for every one, but thou shalt take no money for it.\" When the hut was ready, a sign was hung on the door whereon was written, \"To-day given, to-morrow sold.\" There she remained a long time, and it was rumored about the world that a maiden was there who cooked without asking for payment, and that this was set forth on a sign outside her door. The huntsman heard it likewise, and thought to himself, \"That would suit thee. Thou art poor, and hast no money.\" So he took his air-gun and his knapsack, wherein all the things which he had formerly carried away with him from the castle as tokens of his truthfulness were still lying, and went into the forest, and found the hut with the sign, \"To-day given, to-morrow sold.\" He had put on the sword with which he had cut off the heads of the three giants, and thus entered the hut, and ordered something to eat to be given to him. He was charmed with the beautiful maiden, who was indeed as lovely as any picture. She asked him whence he came and whither he was going, and he said, \"I am roaming about the world.\" Then she asked him where he had got the sword, for that truly her father\'s name was on it. He asked her if she were the King\'s daughter. \"Yes,\" answered she. \"With this sword,\" said he, \"did I cut off the heads of three giants.\" And he took their tongues out of his knapsack in proof. Then he also showed her the slipper, and the corner of the neck-kerchief, and the bit of the night-dress. Hereupon she was overjoyed, and said that he was the one who had delivered her. On this they went together to the old King, and fetched him to the hut, and she led him into her room, and told him that the huntsman was the man who had really set her free from the giants. And when the aged King saw all the proofs of this, he could no longer doubt, and said that he was very glad he knew how everything had happened, and that the huntsman should have her to wife, on which the maiden was glad at heart. Then she dressed the huntsman as if he were a foreign lord, and the King ordered a feast to be prepared. When they went to table, the captain sat on the left side of the King\'s daughter, but the huntsman was on the right, and the captain thought he was a foreign lord who had come on a visit. When they had eaten and drunk, the old King said to the captain that he would set before him something which he must guess. \"Supposing any one said that he had killed the three giants and he were asked where the giants\' tongues were, and he were forced to go and look, and there were none in their heads, how could that happen?\" The captain said, \"Then they cannot have had any.\" - \"Not so,\" said the King. \"Every animal has a tongue,\" and then he likewise asked what any one would deserve who made such an answer? The captain replied, \"He ought to be torn in pieces.\" Then the King said he had pronounced his own sentence, and the captain was put in prison and then torn in four pieces; but the King\'s daughter was married to the huntsman. After this he brought his father and mother, and they lived with their son in happiness, and after the death of the old King he received the kingdom.</string>
    <string name="story422text">In times past there lived a king and queen, who said to each other every day of their lives, \"Would that we had a child!\" and yet they had none. But it happened once that when the queen was bathing, there came a frog out of the water, and he squatted on the ground, and said to her: \"Thy wish shall be fulfilled; before a year has gone by, thou shalt bring a daughter into the world.\"\n\nAnd as the frog foretold, so it happened; and the queen bore a daughter so beautiful that the king could not contain himself for joy, and he ordained a great feast. Not only did he bid to it his relations, friends, and acquaintances, but also the wise women, that they might be kind and favourable to the child. There were thirteen of them in his kingdom, but as he had only provided twelve golden plates for them to eat from, one of them had to be left out.\n\nHowever, the feast was celebrated with all splendour; and as it drew to an end, the wise women stood forward to present to the child their wonderful gifts: one bestowed virtue, one beauty, a third riches, and so on, whatever there is in the world to wish for. And when eleven of them had said their say, in came the uninvited thirteenth, burning to revenge herself, and without greeting or respect, she cried with a loud voice: \"In the fifteenth year of her age the princess shall prick herself with a spindle and shall fall down dead.\" And without speaking one more word she turned away and left the hall. Every one was terrified at her saying, when the twelfth came forward, for she had not yet bestowed her gift, and though she could not do away with the evil prophecy, yet she could soften it, so she said: \"The princess shall not die, but fall into a deep sleep for a hundred years.\"\n\nNow the king, being desirous of saving his child even from this misfortune, gave commandment that all the spindles in his kingdom should be burnt up. The maiden grew up, adorned with all the gifts of the wise women; and she was so lovely, modest, sweet, and kind and clever, that no one who saw her could help loving her. It happened one day, she being already fifteen years old, that the king and queen rode abroad, and the maiden was left behind alone in the castle. She wandered about into all the nooks and corners, and into all the chambers and parlours, as the fancy took her, till at last she came to an old tower. She climbed the narrow winding stair which led to a little door, with a rusty key sticking out of the lock; she turned the key, and the door opened, and there in the little room sat an old woman with a spindle, diligently spinning her flax.\n\n\"Good day, mother,\" said the princess, \"what are you doing?\" - \"I am spinning,\" answered the old woman, nodding her head. \"What thing is that that twists round so briskly?\" asked the maiden, and taking the spindle into her hand she began to spin; but no sooner had she touched it than the evil prophecy was fulfilled, and she pricked her finger with it. In that very moment she fell back upon the bed that stood there, and lay in a deep sleep.\n\nAnd this sleep fell upon the whole castle; the king and queen, who had returned and were in the great hall, fell fast asleep, and with them the whole court. The horses in their stalls, the dogs in the yard, the pigeons on the roof, the flies on the wall, the very fire that flickered on the hearth, became still, and slept like the rest; and the meat on the spit ceased roasting, and the cook, who was going to pull the scullion\'s hair for some mistake he had made, let him go, and went to sleep. And the wind ceased, and not a leaf fell from the trees about the castle. Then round about that place there grew a hedge of thorns thicker every year, until at last the whole castle was hidden from view, and nothing of it could be seen but the vane on the roof.\n\nAnd a rumour went abroad in all that country of the beautiful sleeping Rosamond, for so was the princess called; and from time to time many kings\' sons came and tried to force their way through the hedge; but it was impossible for them to do so, for the thorns held fast together like strong hands, and the young men were caught by them, and not being able to get free, there died a lamentable death.\n\nMany a long year afterwards there came a king\'s son into that country, and heard an old man tell how there should be a castle standing behind the hedge of thorns, and that there a beautiful enchanted princess named Rosamond had slept for a hundred years, and with her the king and queen, and the whole court. The old man had been told by his grandfather that many king\'s sons had sought to pass the thorn-hedge, but had been caught and pierced by the thorns, and had died a miserable death. Then said the young man: \"Nevertheless, I do not fear to try; I shall win through and see the lovely Rosamond.\" The good old man tried to dissuade him, but he would not listen to his words. For now the hundred years were at an end, and the day had come when Rosamond should be awakened. When the prince drew near the hedge of thorns, it was changed into a hedge of beautiful large flowers, which parted and bent aside to let him pass, and then closed behind him in a thick hedge. When he reached the castle-yard, he saw the horses and brindled hunting-dogs lying asleep, and on the roof the pigeons were sitting with their heads under their wings. And when he came indoors, the flies on the wall were asleep, the cook in the kitchen had his hand uplifted to strike the scullion, and the kitchen-maid had the black fowl on her lap ready to pluck.\n\nThen he mounted higher, and saw in the hall the whole court lying asleep, and above them, on their thrones, slept the king and the queen. And still he went farther, and all was so quiet that he could hear his own breathing; and at last he came to the tower, and went up the winding stair, and opened the door of the little room where Rosamond lay. And when he saw her looking so lovely in her sleep, he could not turn away his eyes; and presently he stooped and kissed her.\n\nAnd she awaked, and opened her eyes, and looked very kindly on him. And she rose, and they went forth together, and the king and the queen and whole court waked up, and gazed on each other with great eyes of wonderment. And the horses in the yard got up and shook themselves, the hounds sprang up and wagged their tails, the pigeons on the roof drew their heads from under their wings, looked round, and flew into the field, the flies on the wall crept on a little farther, the kitchen fire leapt up and blazed, and cooked the meat, the joint on the spit began to roast, the cook gave the scullion such a box on the ear that he roared out, and the maid went on plucking the fowl.\n\nThen the wedding of the Prince and Rosamond was held with all splendour, and they lived very happily together until their lives\' end.</string>
    <string name="story423text">There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore white and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the two rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red. They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children in the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than Rose- red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother, and helped her with her house-work, or read to her when there was nothing to do.\nThe two children were so fond of each another that they always held each other by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said, \"We will not leave each other,\" Rose-red answered, \"Never so long as we live,\" and their mother would add, \"What one has she must share with the other.\"\n\nThey often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon the boughs, and sang whatever they knew.\n\nNo mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss, and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and had no distress on their account.\n\nOnce when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing and went away into the forest. And when they looked round they found that they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces further. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who watches over good children.\n\nSnow-white and Rose-red kept their mother\'s little cottage so neat that it was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother\'s bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the wrekin. The kettle was of copper and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said, \"Go, Snow-white, and bolt the door,\" and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls listened as they sat and span. And close by them lay a lamb upon the floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head hidden beneath its wings.\n\nOne evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, some one knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said, \"Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking shelter.\" Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door.\n\nRose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered, and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother\'s bed. But the bear began to speak and said, \"Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.\"\n\n\"Poor bear,\" said the mother, \"lie down by the fire, only take care that you do not burn your coat.\" Then she cried, \"Snow-white, Rose-red, come out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.\" So they both came out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid of him. The bear said, \"Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a little;\" so they brought the broom and swept the bear\'s hide clean; and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and comfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played tricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands, put their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a hazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the bear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called out, \"Leave me alive, children,\n\n\n\"Snowy-white, Rosy-red,\nWill you beat your lover dead?\"\nWhen it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the bear, \"You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from the cold and the bad weather.\" As soon as day dawned the two children let him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest.\nHenceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as much as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were never fastened until their black friend had arrived.\n\nWhen spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow-white, \"Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the whole summer.\" - \"Where are you going, then, dear bear?\" asked Snow-white. \"I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked dwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to pry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves, does not easily see daylight again.\"\n\nSnow-white was quite sorry for his going away, and as she unbolted the door for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white as if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about it. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the trees.\n\nA short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest to get fire-wood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and forwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When they came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a crevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping backwards and forwards like a dog tied to a rope, and did not know what to do.\n\nHe glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried, \"Why do you stand there? Can you not come here and help me?\" - \"What are you about there, little man?\" asked Rose-red. \"You stupid, prying goose!\" answered the dwarf; \"I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking. The little bit of food that one of us wants gets burnt up directly with thick logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished; but the wretched wood was too smooth and suddenly sprang asunder, and the tree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white beard; so now it is tight in and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek, milk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!\"\n\nThe children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it was caught too fast. \"I will run and fetch some one,\" said Rose-red. \"You senseless goose!\" snarled the dwarf; why should you fetch some one? You are already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?\" - \"Don\'t be impatient,\" said Snow-white, \"I will help you,\" and she pulled her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.\n\nAs soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it up, grumbling to himself, \"Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine beard. Bad luck to you!\" and then he swung the bag upon his back, and went off without even once looking at the children.\n\nSome time after that Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish of fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large grasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in. They ran to it and found it was the dwarf. \"Where are you going?\" said Rose-red; \"you surely don\'t want to go into the water?\" - \"I am not such a fool!\" cried the dwarf; don\'t you see that the accursed fish wants to pull me in?\" The little man had been sitting there fishing, and unluckily the wind had twisted his beard with the fishing-line; just then a big fish bit, and the feeble creature had not strength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the dwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of little good, he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and was in urgent danger of being dragged into the water.\n\nThe girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his beard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast together. Nothing was left but to bring out the scissors and cut the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that he screamed out, \"Is that civil, you toad-stool, to disfigure one\'s face? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have cut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people. I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!\" Then he took out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without saying a word more he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.\n\nIt happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn here and there. Now they noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and round above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a rock not far off. Directly afterwards they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran up and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance the dwarf, and was going to carry him off.\n\nThe children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man, and pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go. As soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried with his shrill voice, \"Could you not have done it more carefully! You dragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you helpless clumsy creatures!\" Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and slipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by this time were used to his thanklessness, went on their way and did their business in the town.\n\nAs they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the dwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot, and had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening sun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with all colors so beautifully that the children stood still and looked at them. \"Why do you stand gaping there?\" cried the dwarf, and his ashen-gray face became copper-red with rage. He was going on with his bad words when a loud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out of the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not get to his cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart he cried, \"Dear Mr. Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures; look, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you want with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me between your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender morsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy\'s sake eat them!\" The bear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single blow with his paw, and he did not move again.\n\nThe girls had run away, but the bear called to them, \"Snow-white and Rose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.\" Then they knew his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly his bearskin fell off, and he stood there, a handsome man, clothed all in gold. \"I am a King\'s son,\" he said, \"and I was bewitched by that wicked dwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest as a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his well-deserved punishment.\"\n\nSnow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered together in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with her children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and they stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful roses, white and red.</string>
    <string name="story424text">It was the middle of winter, and the snow-flakes were falling like feathers from the sky, and a queen sat at her window working, and her embroidery-frame was of ebony. And as she worked, gazing at times out on the snow, she pricked her finger, and there fell from it three drops of blood on the snow. And when she saw how bright and red it looked, she said to herself, \"Oh that I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the wood of the embroidery frame!\" Not very long after she had a daughter, with a skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony, and she was named Snow-white. And when she was born the queen died. After a year had gone by the king took another wife, a beautiful woman, but proud and overbearing, and she could not bear to be surpassed in beauty by any one. She had a magic looking-glass, and she used to stand before it, and look in it, and say,\n\n\"Looking-glass upon the wall,\nWho is fairest of us all?\"\n\nAnd the looking-glass would answer,\n\n\"You are fairest of them all.\"\n\nAnd she was contented, for she knew that the looking-glass spoke the truth. Now, Snow-white was growing prettier and prettier, and when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as day, far more so than the queen herself. So one day when the queen went to her mirror and said,\n\n\"Looking-glass upon the wall,\nWho is fairest of us all?\"\n\nIt answered,\n\n\"Queen, you are full fair, \'tis true,\nBut Snow-white fairer is than you.\"\n\nThis gave the queen a great shock, and she became yellow and green with envy, and from that hour her heart turned against Snow-white, and she hated her. And envy and pride like ill weeds grew in her heart higher every day, until she had no peace day or night. At last she sent for a huntsman, and said, \"Take the child out into the woods, so that I may set eyes on her no more. You must put her to death, and bring me her heart for a token.\" The huntsman consented, and led her away; but when he drew his cutlass to pierce Snow-white\'s innocent heart, she began to weep, and to say, \"Oh, dear huntsman, do not take my life; I will go away into the wild wood, and never come home again.\" And as she was so lovely the huntsman had pity on her, and said, \"Away with you then, poor child;\" for he thought the wild animals would be sure to devour her, and it was as if a stone had been rolled away from his heart when he spared to put her to death. Just at that moment a young wild boar came running by, so he caught and killed it, and taking out its heart, he brought it to the queen for a token. And it was salted and cooked, and the wicked woman ate it up, thinking that there was an end of Snow-white.\n\nNow, when the poor child found herself quite alone in the wild woods, she felt full of terror, even of the very leaves on the trees, and she did not know what to do for fright. Then she began to run over the sharp stones and through the thorn bushes, and the wild beasts after her, but they did her no harm. She ran as long as her feet would carry her; and when the evening drew near she came to a little house, and she went inside to rest. Everything there was very small, but as pretty and clean as possible. There stood the little table ready laid, and covered with a white cloth, and seven little plates, and seven knives and forks, and drinking-cups. By the wall stood seven little beds, side by side, covered with clean white quilts. Snow-white, being very hungry and thirsty, ate from each plate a little porridge and bread, and drank out of each little cup a drop of wine, so as not to finish up one portion alone. After that she felt so tired that she lay down on one of the beds, but it did not seem to suit her; one was too long, another too short, but at last the seventh was quite right; and so she lay down upon it, committed herself to heaven, and fell asleep.\n\nWhen it was quite dark, the masters of the house came home. They were seven dwarfs, whose occupation was to dig underground among the mountains. When they had lighted their seven candles, and it was quite light in the little house, they saw that some one must have been in, as everything was not in the same order in which they left it. The first said, \"Who has been sitting in my little chair?\" The second said, \"Who has been eating from my little plate?\" The third said, \"Who has been taking my little loaf?\" The fourth said, \"Who has been tasting my porridge?\" The fifth said, \"Who has been using my little fork?\" The sixth said, \"Who has been cutting with my little knife?\" The seventh said, \"Who has been drinking from my little cup?\" Then the first one, looking round, saw a hollow in his bed, and cried, \"Who has been lying on my bed?\" And the others came running, and cried, \"Some one has been on our beds too!\" But when the seventh looked at his bed, he saw little Snow-white lying there asleep. Then he told the others, who came running up, crying out in their astonishment, and holding up their seven little candles to throw a light upon Snow-white. \"O goodness! O gracious!\" cried they, \"what beautiful child is this?\" and were so full of joy to see her that they did not wake her, but let her sleep on. And the seventh dwarf slept with his comrades, an hour at a time with each, until the night had passed. When it was morning, and Snow-white awoke and saw the seven dwarfs, she was very frightened; but they seemed quite friendly, and asked her what her name was, and she told them; and then they asked how she came to be in their house. And she related to them how her step-mother had wished her to be put to death, and how the huntsman had spared her life, and how she had run the whole day long, until at last she had found their little house. Then the dwarfs said, \"If you will keep our house for us, and cook, and wash, and make the beds, and sew and knit, and keep everything tidy and clean, you may stay with us, and you shall lack nothing.\" - \"With all my heart,\" said Snow-white; and so she stayed, and kept the house in good order. In the morning the dwarfs went to the mountain to dig for gold; in the evening they came home, and their supper had to be ready for them. All the day long the maiden was left alone, and the good little dwarfs warned her, saying, \"Beware of your step-mother, she will soon know you are here. Let no one into the house.\" Now the queen, having eaten Snow-white\'s heart, as she supposed, felt quite sure that now she was the first and fairest, and so she came to her mirror, and said,\n\n\"Looking-glass upon the wall,\nWho is fairest of us all?\"\n\nAnd the glass answered,\n\n\"Queen, thou art of beauty rare,\nBut Snow-white living in the glen\nWith the seven little men\nIs a thousand times more fair.\"\n\nThen she was very angry, for the glass always spoke the truth, and she knew that the huntsman must have deceived her, and that Snow-white must still be living. And she thought and thought how she could manage to make an end of her, for as long as she was not the fairest in the land, envy left her no rest. At last she thought of a plan; she painted her face and dressed herself like an old pedlar woman, so that no one would have known her. In this disguise she went across the seven mountains, until she came to the house of the seven little dwarfs, and she knocked at the door and cried, \"Fine wares to sell! fine wares to sell!\" Snow-white peeped out of the window and cried, \"Good-day, good woman, what have you to sell?\" - \"Good wares, fine wares,\" answered she, \"laces of all colours;\"and she held up a piece that was woven of variegated silk. \"I need not be afraid of letting in this good woman,\" thought Snow-white, and she unbarred the door and bought the pretty lace. \"What a figure you are, child!\" said the old woman, \"come and let me lace you properly for once.\" Snow-white, suspecting nothing, stood up before her, and let her lace her with the new lace; but the old woman laced so quick and tight that it took Snow-white\'s breath away, and she fell down as dead. \"Now you have done with being the fairest,\" said the old woman as she hastened away. Not long after that, towards evening, the seven dwarfs came home, and were terrified to see their dear Snow-white lying on the ground, without life or motion; they raised her up, and when they saw how tightly she was laced they cut the lace in two; then she began to draw breath, and little by little she returned to life. When the dwarfs heard what had happened they said, \"The old pedlar woman was no other than the wicked queen; you must beware of letting any one in when we are not here!\" And when the wicked woman got home she went to her glass and said,\n\n\"Looking-glass against the wall,\nWho is fairest of us all?\"\n\nAnd it answered as before,\n\n\"Queen, thou art of beauty rare,\nBut Snow-white living in the glen\nWith the seven little men\nIs a thousand times more fair.\"\n\nWhen she heard that she was so struck with surprise that all the blood left her heart, for she knew that Snow-white must still be living. \"But now,\" said she, \"I will think of something that will be her ruin.\" And by witchcraft she made a poisoned comb. Then she dressed herself up to look like another different sort of old woman. So she went across the seven mountains and came to the house of the seven dwarfs, and knocked at the door and cried, \"Good wares to sell! good wares to sell!\" Snow-white looked out and said, \"Go away, I must not let anybody in.\" - \"But you are not forbidden to look,\" said the old woman, taking out the poisoned comb and holding it up. It pleased the poor child so much that she was tempted to open the door; and when the bargain was made the old woman said, \"Now, for once your hair shall be properly combed.\" Poor Snow-white, thinking no harm, let the old woman do as she would, but no sooner was the comb put in her hair than the poison began to work, and the poor girl fell down senseless. \"Now, you paragon of beauty,\" said the wicked woman, \"this is the end of you,\" and went off. By good luck it was now near evening, and the seven little dwarfs came home. When they saw Snow-white lying on the ground as dead, they thought directly that it was the step-mother\'s doing, and looked about, found the poisoned comb, and no sooner had they drawn it out of her hair than Snow-white came to herself, and related all that had passed. Then they warned her once more to be on her guard, and never again to let any one in at the door. And the queen went home and stood before the looking-glass and said,\n\n\"Looking-glass against the wall,\nWho is fairest of us all?\"\n\nAnd the looking-glass answered as before,\n\n\"Queen, thou art of beauty rare,\nBut Snow-white living in the glen\nWith the seven little men\nIs a thousand times more fair.\"\n\nWhen she heard the looking-glass speak thus she trembled and shook with anger. \"Snow-white shall die,\" cried she, \"though it should cost me my own life!\" And then she went to a secret lonely chamber, where no one was likely to come, and there she made a poisonous apple. It was beautiful to look upon, being white with red cheeks, so that any one who should see it must long for it, but whoever ate even a little bit of it must die. When the apple was ready she painted her face and clothed herself like a peasant woman, and went across the seven mountains to where the seven dwarfs lived. And when she knocked at the door Snow-white put her head out of the window and said, \"I dare not let anybody in; the seven dwarfs told me not.\" - \"All right,\" answered the woman; \"I can easily get rid of my apples elsewhere. There, I will give you one.\" - \"No,\" answered Snow-white, \"I dare not take anything.\" - \"Are you afraid of poison?\" said the woman, \"look here, I will cut the apple in two pieces; you shall have the red side, I will have the white one.\" For the apple was so cunningly made, that all the poison was in the rosy half of it. Snow-white longed for the beautiful apple, and as she saw the peasant woman eating a piece of it she could no longer refrain, but stretched out her hand and took the poisoned half. But no sooner had she taken a morsel of it into her mouth than she fell to the earth as dead. And the queen, casting on her a terrible glance, laughed aloud and cried, \"As white as snow, as red as blood, as black as ebony! this time the dwarfs will not be able to bring you to life again.\" And when she went home and asked the looking-glass,\n\n\"Looking-glass against the wall,\nWho is fairest of us all?\"\n\nat last it answered,\n\n\"You are the fairest now of all.\"\n\nThen her envious heart had peace, as much as an envious heart can have. The dwarfs, when they came home in the evening, found Snow-white lying on the ground, and there came no breath out of her mouth, and she was dead. They lifted her up, sought if anything poisonous was to be found, cut her laces, combed her hair, washed her with water and wine, but all was of no avail, the poor child was dead, and remained dead. Then they laid her on a bier, and sat all seven of them round it, and wept and lamented three whole days. And then they would have buried her, but that she looked still as if she were living, with her beautiful blooming cheeks. So they said, \"We cannot hide her away in the black ground.\" And they had made a coffin of clear glass, so as to be looked into from all sides, and they laid her in it, and wrote in golden letters upon it her name, and that she was a king\'s daughter. Then they set the coffin out upon the mountain, and one of them always remained by it to watch. And the birds came too, and mourned for Snow-white, first an owl, then a raven, and lastly, a dove. Now, for a long while Snow-white lay in the coffin and never changed, but looked as if she were asleep, for she was still as\' white as snow, as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony. It happened, however, that one day a king\'s son rode through the wood and up to the dwarfs\' house, which was near it. He saw on the mountain the coffin, and beautiful Snow-white within it, and he read what was written in golden letters upon it. Then he said to the dwarfs, \"Let me have the coffin, and I will give you whatever you like to ask for it.\" But the dwarfs told him that they could not part with it for all the gold in the world. But he said, \"I beseech you to give it me, for I cannot live without looking upon Snow-white; if you consent I will bring you to great honour, and care for you as if you were my brethren.\" When he so spoke the good little dwarfs had pity upon him and gave him the coffin, and the king\'s son called his servants and bid them carry it away on their shoulders. Now it happened that as they were going along they stumbled over a bush, and with the shaking the bit of poisoned apple flew out of her throat. It was not long before she opened her eyes, threw up the cover of the coffin, and sat up, alive and well. \"Oh dear! where am I?\" cried she. The king\'s son answered, full of joy, \"You are near me,\" and, relating all that had happened, he said, \"I would rather have you than anything in the world; come with me to my father\'s castle and you shall be my bride.\" And Snow-white was kind, and went with him, and their wedding was held with pomp and great splendour. But Snow-white\'s wicked step-mother was also bidden to the feast, and when she had dressed herself in beautiful clothes she went to her looking-glass and said,\n\n\"Looking-glass upon the wall,\nWho is fairest of us all?\"\n\nThe looking-glass answered,\n\n\'\'O Queen, although you are of beauty rare,\nThe young bride is a thousand times more fair.\"\n\nThen she railed and cursed, and was beside herself with disappointment and anger. First she thought she would not go to the wedding; but then she felt she should have no peace until she went and saw the bride. And when she saw her she knew her for Snow-white, and could not stir from the place for anger and terror. For they had ready red-hot iron shoes, in which she had to dance until she fell down dead.</string>
    <string name="story425text">The fishes had for a long time been discontented because no order prevailed in their kingdom. None of them turned aside for the others, but all swam to the right or the left as they fancied, or darted between those who wanted to stay together, or got into their way; and a strong one gave a weak one a blow with its tail, which drove it away, or else swallowed it up without more ado. \"How delightful it would be,\" said they, \"if we had a king who enforced law and justice among us!\" and they met together to choose for their ruler, the one who could cleave through the water most quickly, and give help to the weak ones.\nThey placed themselves in rank and file by the shore, and the pike gave the signal with his tail, on which they all started. Like an arrow, the pike darted away, and with him the herring, the gudgeon, the perch, the carp, and all the rest of them. Even the sole swam with them, and hoped to reach the winning-place. All at once, the cry was heard, \"The herring is first!\" - \"Who is first?\" screamed angrily the flat envious sole, who had been left far behind, \"who is first?\" - \"The herring! The herring,\" was the answer. \"The naked herring?\" cried the jealous creature, \"the naked herring?\" Since that time the sole\'s mouth has been at one side for a punishment.</string>
    <string name="story426text">A sparrow had four young ones in a swallow\'s nest. When they were fledged, some naughty boys pulled out the nest, but fortunately all the birds got safely away in the high wind. Then the old bird was grieved that as his sons had all gone out into the world, he had not first warned them of every kind of danger, and given them good instruction how to deal with each. In the autumn a great many sparrows assembled together in a wheatfield, and there the old bird met his four children again, and full of joy took them home with him. \"Ah, my dear sons, what pain I have been in about you all through the summer, because you got away in the wind without my teaching; listen to my words, obey your father, and be well on your guard. Little birds have to encounter great dangers!\" And then he asked the eldest where he had spent the summer, and how he had supported himself? \"I stayed in the gardens, and looked for caterpillars and small worms, until the cherries got ripe.\" - \"Ah, my son,\" said the father, \"tit-bits are not bad, but there is great risk about them; on that account take great care of thyself henceforth, and particularly when people are going about the gardens who carry long green poles which are hollow inside and have a little hole at the top.\" - \"Yes, father, but what if a little green leaf is stuck over the hole with wax?\" said the son. \"Where hast thou seen that?\" - \"In a merchant\'s garden,\" said the youngster. \"Oh, my son, merchant folks are quick folks,\" said the father. \"If thou hast been among the children of the world, thou hast learned worldly shiftiness enough, only see that thou usest it well, and do not be too confident.\" After this he asked the next, \"Where hast thou passed thy time?\" - \"At court,\" said the son. \"Sparrows and silly little birds are of no use in that place — there one finds much gold, velvet, silk, armour, harnesses, sparrow-hawks, screech-owls and hen-harriers; keep to the horses\' stable where they winnow oats, or thresh, and then fortune may give thee thy daily grain of corn in peace.\" - \"Yes, father,\" said the son, \"but when the stable-boys make traps and fix their gins and snares in the straw, many a one is caught fast.\" Where hast thou seen that?\" said the old bird. \"At court, among the stable-boys.\" - \"Oh, my son, court boys are bad boys! If thou hast been to court and among the lords, and hast left no feathers there, thou hast learnt a fair amount, and wilt know very well how to go about the world, but look around thee and above thee, for the wolves devour the wisest dogs.\" The father examined the third also: \"Where didst thou seek thy safety?\" - \"I have broken up tubs and ropes on the cart-roads and highways, and sometimes met with a grain of corn or barley.\" - \"That is indeed dainty fare,\" said the father, \"but take care what thou art about and look carefully around, especially when thou seest any one stooping and about to pick up a stone, there is not much time to stay then.\" - \"That is true,\" said the son, \"but what if any one should carry a bit of rock, or ore, ready beforehand in his breast or pocket?\" - \"Where hast thou seen that?\" - \"Among the mountaineers, dear father; when they go out, they generally take little bits of ore with them.\" - \"Mountain folks are working folks, and clever folks. If thou hast been among mountain lads, thou hast seen and learnt something, but when thou goest thither beware, for many a sparrow has been brought to a bad end by a mountain boy.\" At length the father came to the youngest son: \"Thou, my dear chirping nestling, wert always the silliest and weakest; stay with me, the world has many rough, wicked birds which have crooked beaks and long claws, and lie in wait for poor little birds and swallow them. Keep with those of thine own kind, and pick up little spiders and caterpillars from the trees, or the house, and then thou wilt live long in peace.\" - \"My dear father, he who feeds himself without injury to other people fares well, and no sparrow-hawk, eagle, or kite will hurt him if he specially commits himself and his lawful food, evening and morning, faithfully to God, who is the Creator and Preserver of all forest and village birds, who likewise heareth the cry and prayer of the young ravens, for no sparrow or wren ever falls to the ground except by his will.\" - \"Where hast thou learnt this?\" The son answered, \"When the great blast of wind tore me away from thee I came to a church, and there during the summer I have picked up the flies and spiders from the windows, and heard this discourse preached. The Father of all sparrows fed me all the summer through, and kept me from all mischance and from ferocious birds.\"\n\"In sooth, my dear son, if thou takest refuge in the churches and helpest to clear away spiders and buzzing flies, and criest unto God like the young ravens, and commendest thyself to the eternal Creator, all will be well with thee, and that even if the whole world were full of wild malicious birds.\"\n\n\"He who to God commits his ways,\nIn silence suffers, waits, and prays,\nPreserves his faith and conscience pure,\nHe is of God\'s protection sure.\"</string>
    <string name="story427text">There was once a girl whose father and mother died while she was still a little child. All alone, in a small house at the end of the village, dwelt her godmother, who supported herself by spinning, weaving, and sewing. The old woman took the forlorn child to live with her, kept her to her work, and educated her in all that is good. When the girl was fifteen years old, the old woman became ill, called the child to her bedside, and said, \"Dear daughter, I feel my end drawing near. I leave thee the little house, which will protect thee from wind and weather, and my spindle, shuttle, and needle, with which thou canst earn thy bread.\" Then she laid her hands on the girl\'s head, blessed her, and said, \"Only preserve the love of God in thy heart, and all will go well with thee.\" Thereupon she closed her eyes, and when she was laid in the earth, the maiden followed the coffin, weeping bitterly, and paid her the last mark of respect. And now the maiden lived quite alone in the little house, and was industrious, and span, wove, and sewed, and the blessing of the good old woman was on all that she did. It seemed as if the flax in the room increased of its own accord, and whenever she wove a piece of cloth or carpet, or had made a shirt, she at once found a buyer who paid her amply for it, so that she was in want of nothing, and even had something to share with others.\nAbout this time, the son of the King was travelling about the country looking for a bride. He was not to choose a poor one, and did not want to have a rich one. So he said, \"She shall be my wife who is the poorest, and at the same time the richest.\" When he came to the village where the maiden dwelt, he inquired, as he did wherever he went, who was the richest and also the poorest girl in the place? They first named the richest; the poorest, they said, was the girl who lived in the small house quite at the end of the village. The rich girl was sitting in all her splendour before the door of her house, and when the prince approached her, she got up, went to meet him, and made him a low curtsey. He looked at her, said nothing, and rode on. When he came to the house of the poor girl, she was not standing at the door, but sitting in her little room. He stopped his horse, and saw through the window, on which the bright sun was shining, the girl sitting at her spinning-wheel, busily spinning. She looked up, and when she saw that the prince was looking in, she blushed all over her face, let her eyes fall, and went on spinning. I do not know whether, just at that moment, the thread was quite even; but she went on spinning until the King\'s son had ridden away again. Then she went to the window, opened it, and said, \"It is so warm in this room!\" but she still looked after him as long as she could distinguish the white feathers in his hat. Then she sat down to work again in her own room and went on with her spinning, and a saying which the old woman had often repeated when she was sitting at her work, came into her mind, and she sang these words to herself, —\n\n\"Spindle, my spindle, haste, haste thee away,\nAnd here to my house bring the wooer, I pray.\"\nAnd what do you think happened? The spindle sprang out of her hand in an instant, and out of the door, and when, in her astonishment, she got up and looked after it, she saw that it was dancing out merrily into the open country, and drawing a shining golden thread after it. Before long, it had entirely vanished from her sight. As she had now no spindle, the girl took the weaver\'s shuttle in her hand, sat down to her loom, and began to weave.\nThe spindle, however, danced continually onwards, and just as the thread came to an end, reached the prince. \"What do I see?\" he cried; \"the spindle certainly wants to show me the way!\" turned his horse about, and rode back with the golden thread. The girl was, however, sitting at her work singing,\n\n\"Shuttle, my shuttle, weave well this day,\nAnd guide the wooer to me, I pray.\"\nImmediately the shuttle sprang out of her hand and out by the door. Before the threshold, however, it began to weave a carpet which was more beautiful than the eyes of man had ever yet beheld. Lilies and roses blossomed on both sides of it, and on a golden ground in the centre green branches ascended, under which bounded hares and rabbits, stags and deer stretched their heads in between them, brightly-coloured birds were sitting in the branches above; they lacked nothing but the gift of song. The shuttle leapt hither and thither, and everything seemed to grow of its own accord.\nAs the shuttle had run away, the girl sat down to sew. She held the needle in her hand and sang,\n\n\"Needle, my needle, sharp-pointed and fine,\nPrepare for a wooer this house of mine.\"\nThen the needle leapt out of her fingers, and flew everywhere about the room as quick as lightning. It was just as if invisible spirits were working; they covered tables and benches with green cloth in an instant, and the chairs with velvet, and hung the windows with silken curtains. Hardly had the needle put in the last stitch than the maiden saw through the window the white feathers of the prince, whom the spindle had brought thither by the golden thread. He alighted, stepped over the carpet into the house, and when he entered the room, there stood the maiden in her poor garments, but she shone out from within them like a rose surrounded by leaves. \"Thou art the poorest and also the richest,\" said he to her. \"Come with me, thou shalt be my bride.\" She did not speak, but she gave him her hand. Then he gave her a kiss, led her forth, lifted her on to his horse, and took her to the royal castle, where the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicings. The spindle, shuttle, and needle were preserved in the treasure-chamber, and held in great honour.</string>
    <string name="story428text">Once upon a time there was a poor woodcutter who worked from morning until late at night. When he had finally saved up some money he said to his boy, \"You are my only child. I want to spend the money that I have earned by the sweat of my brow on your education. Learn an honest trade so you can support me in my old age when my limbs have grown stiff and I have to sit at home.\" Then the boy went to a university and studied diligently. His teachers praised him, and he remained there for some time. After he had worked through a few classes, but was still not perfect in everything, the little pittance that the father had saved was all spent, and the boy had to return home to him. \"Oh,\" said the father sadly, \"I cannot give you anything more, and in these hard times I cannot earn a heller more than what we need for our daily bread.\" - \"Father, dear,\" answered the son, \"don\'t worry about it. If it is God\'s will everything will turn out well for me. I will do all right.\" When the father said he was going into the woods and earn some money by cutting cordwood, the son said, \"I will go with you and help you.\" - \"No, my son,\" said the father, \"you will find it too difficult. You are not used to hard work, and will not be able to do it. Furthermore, I have only one ax and no money left to buy another one with.\" - \"Just go to the neighbor,\" answered the son. \"He will lend you his ax until I have earned enough to buy one for myself.\"\n\nSo the father borrowed an ax from the neighbor, and the next morning at daybreak they went out into the woods together. The son helped his father and was quite cheerful and full of energy. When the sun was directly above them, the father said, \"Let us rest now and eat our noon meal. Then all will go twice as well.\" The son picked up his bread and said, \"Just you rest, father. I am not tired. I will walk about a little in the woods and look for birds\' nests.\" - \"Oh, you fool,\" said the father, \"why do you want to run about? Afterwards you will be tired and no longer able to lift an arm. Stay here, and sit down beside me.\"\n\nBut the son went into the woods, ate his bread, was very cheerful, and looked into the green branches to see if he could find a bird\'s nest. He walked to and fro until at last he came to an enormous oak that was certainly many hundred years old, and that five men would not have been able to span. He stood there looking at it, and thought, \"Many a bird must have built its nest in that tree.\" Then suddenly he thought that he heard a voice. Listening, he became aware of someone calling out with a muffled voice, \"Let me out. Let me out.\" He looked around but could not see anything. Then he thought that the voice was coming out of the ground, so he shouted, \"Where are you?\" The voice answered, \"I am stuck down here among the oak roots. Let me out. Let me out.\" The student began to scrape about beneath the tree, searching among the roots, until at last he found a glass bottle in a little opening. Lifting it up, he held it against the light, and then saw something shaped like a frog jumping up and down inside. \"Let me out. Let me out,\" it cried again, and the student, thinking no evil, pulled the cork from the bottle. Immediately a spirit ascended from it and began to grow. It grew so fast that within a few moments a horrible fellow, half as big as the tree, was standing there before the student. \"Do you know,\" he cried in an terrifying voice, \"what your reward is for having let me out?\" - \"No,\" replied the student fearlessly. \"How should I know that?\" - \"Then I will tell you,\" shouted the spirit. \"I must break your neck for it.\" - \"You should have said so sooner,\" answered the student, \"for then I would have left you shut up inside. However, my head is going to stay where it is until more people have been consulted.\" - \"More people here, more people there,\" shouted the spirit. \"You shall have the reward you have earned. Do you think that I was shut up there for such a long time as a favor? No, it was a punishment. I am the mighty Mercurius. I must break the neck of whomsoever releases me.\" - \"Calm down,\" answered the student. \"Not so fast. First I must know that you really were shut up in that little bottle, and that you are the right spirit. If you can indeed get inside again, then I will believe it, and you may do with me whatsoever you want.\" The spirit said arrogantly, \"that is an easy trick,\" pulling himself in and making himself as thin and short as he had been before. He then crept back into the opening and through the neck of the bottle. He was scarcely inside when the student pushed the cork back into the bottle, and threw it back where it had been among the oak roots. And thus the spirit was deceived.\n\nThe student was about to return to his father, but the spirit cried out pitifully, \"Oh, do let me out. Oh, do let me out.\" - \"No,\" answered the student, \"not a second time. I will not release a person who once tried to kill me, now that I have captured him again.\" - \"If you will set me free,\" cried the spirit, \"I will give you so much that you will have enough for all the days of your life.\" - \"No,\" answered the student, \"you would cheat me like you tried to the first time.\" - \"You are giving away your own good fortune,\" said the spirit. \"I will not harm you, but instead will reward you richly.\" The student thought, \"I will venture it. Perhaps he will keep his word, and in any event he will not get the better of me.\" So he pulled out the cork, and the spirit rose up from the bottle as before, and extended himself, becoming as large as a giant. \"Now you shall have your reward,\" he said, handing the student a little rag that looked just like a small bandage. He said, \"If you rub a wound with the one end, it will heal, and if you rub steel or iron with the other end, it will turn into silver.\" - \"I have to try that,\" said the student. He went to a tree, scratched the bark with his ax, then rubbed it with the one end of the bandage. It immediately closed together and was healed. \"Now it is all right,\" he said to the spirit, \"and we can part.\" The spirit thanked him for having freed him, and the student thanked the spirit for the present, and returned to his father.\n\n\"Where have you been running about?\" said the father. \"Why have you forgotten your work? I said that you wouldn\'t get anything done.\" - \"Don\'t be concerned, father. I will make it up.\" - \"Make it up indeed,\" said the father angrily. \"Don\'t bother.\" - \"Just watch, father. I will soon cut down that tree there and make it crash.\" Then he took his bandage, rubbed the ax with it, and struck a mighty blow, but because the iron had turned into silver, the cutting edge bent back on itself. \"Hey, father, just look what a bad ax you\'ve given me. It is all bent out of shape.\" The father was shocked and said, \"Oh, what have you done! Now I\'ll have to pay for the ax, and I don\'t know what with. That is all the good I have from your work.\" - \"Don\'t get angry,\" said the son, \"I will pay for the ax.\" - \"Oh, you blockhead,\" cried the father, \"How will you pay for it? You have nothing but what I give you. You have students\' tricks stuck in your head, but you don\'t know anything about chopping wood.\"\n\nAfter a little while the student said, \"Father, I can\'t work any longer after all. Let\'s quit for the day.\" - \"Now then,\" he answered, \"do you think I can stand around with my hands in my pockets like you? I have to go on working, but you may head for home.\" - \"Father, I am here in these woods for the first time. I don\'t know my way alone. Please go with me.\" His anger had now subsided, so the father at last let himself be talked into going home with him. There he said to the son, \"Go and sell the damaged ax and see what you can get for it. I will have to earn the difference, in order to pay the neighbor.\" The son picked up the ax and took it into town to a goldsmith, who tested it, weighed it, and then said, \"It is worth four hundred talers. I do not have that much cash with me.\" The student said, \"Give me what you have. I will lend you the rest.\" The goldsmith gave him three hundred talers and owed him one hundred. Then the student went home and said, \"Father, I have some money. Go and ask the neighbor what he wants for the ax.\" - \"I already know,\" answered the old man. \"One taler, six groschens.\" - \"Then give him two talers, twelve groschens. That is double its worth and is plenty. See, I have more than enough money.\" Then he gave the father a hundred talers, saying, \"You shall never need anything. Live just like you want to.\" - \"My goodness,\" said the old man. \"Where did you get all that money?\" Then the son told him everything that had happened, and how by trusting in his luck he had made such a catch. With the money that was left he went back to the university and continued his studies, and because he could heal all wounds with his bandage he became the most famous doctor in the whole world.</string>
    <string name="story429text">There was once on a time a mother who had three daughters, the eldest of whom was rude and wicked, the second much better, although she had her faults, but the youngest was a pious, good child. The mother was, however, so strange, that it was just the eldest daughter whom she most loved, and she could not bear the youngest. On this account, she often sent the poor girl out into the great forest in order to get rid of her, for she thought she would lose herself and never come back again. But the guardian-angel which every good child has, did not forsake her, but always brought her into the right path again. Once, however, the guardian-angel behaved as if he were not there, and the child could not find her way out of the forest again. She walked on constantly until evening came, and then she saw a tiny light burning in the distance, ran up to it at once, and came to a little hut. She knocked, the door opened, and she came to a second door, where she knocked again. An old man, who had a snow-white beard and looked venerable, opened it for her; and he was no other than St. Joseph. He said quite kindly, \"Come, dear child, seat thyself on my little chair by the fire, and warm thyself; I will fetch thee clear water if thou art thirsty; but here in the forest, I have nothing for thee to eat but a couple of little roots, which thou must first scrape and boil.\"\nSt. Joseph gave her the roots. The girl scraped them clean, then she brought a piece of pancake and the bread that her mother had given her to take with her; mixed all together in a pan, and cooked herself a thick soup. When it was ready, St. Joseph said, \"I am so hungry; give me some of thy food. The child was quite willing, and gave him more than she kept for herself, but God\'s blessing was with her, so that she was satisfied. When they had eaten, St. Joseph said, \"Now we will go to bed; I have, however, only one bed, lay thyself in it. I will lie on the ground on the straw.\" - \"No,\" answered she, \"stay in your own bed, the straw is soft enough for me.\" St. Joseph, however, took the child in his arms, and carried her into the little bed, and there she said her prayers, and fell asleep. Next morning when she awoke, she wanted to say good morning to St. Joseph, but she did not see him. Then she got up and looked for him, but could not find him anywhere; at last she perceived, behind the door, a bag with money so heavy that she could just carry it, and on it was written that it was for the child who had slept there that night. On this she took the bag, bounded away with it, and got safely to her mother, and as she gave her mother all the money, she could not help being satisfied with her.\n\nThe next day, the second child also took a fancy to go into the forest. Her mother gave her a much larger piece of pancake and bread. It happened with her just as with the first child. In the evening she came to St. Joseph\'s little hut, who gave her roots for a thick soup. When it was ready, he likewise said to her, \"I am so hungry, give me some of thy food.\" Then the child said, \"You may have your share.\" Afterwards, when St. Joseph offered her his bed and wanted to lie on the straw, she replied, \"No, lie down in the bed, there is plenty of room for both of us.\" St. Joseph took her in his arms and put her in the bed, and laid himself on the straw.\n\nIn the morning when the child awoke and looked for St. Joseph, he had vanished, but behind the door she found a little sack of money that was about as long as a hand, and on it was written that it was for the child who had slept there last night. So she took the little bag and ran home with it, and took it to her mother, but she secretly kept two pieces for herself.\n\nThe eldest daughter had by this time grown curious, and the next morning also insisted on going out into the forest. Her mother gave her pancakes with her — as many as she wanted, and bread and cheese as well. In the evening she found St. Joseph in his little hut, just as the two others had found him. When the soup was ready and St. Joseph said, \"I am so hungry, give me some of thy food,\" the girl answered, \"Wait until I am satisfied; then if there is anything left thou shalt have it.\" She ate, however, nearly the whole of it, and St. Joseph had to scrape the dish. Afterwards, the good old man offered her his bed, and wanted to lie on the straw. She took it without making any opposition, laid herself down in the little bed, and left the hard straw to the white-haired man. Next morning when she awoke, St. Joseph was not to be found, but she did not trouble herself about that. She looked behind the door for a money-bag. She fancied something was lying on the ground, but as she could not very well distinguish what it was, she stooped down, and examined it closely, but it remained hanging to her nose, and when she got up again, she saw, to her horror, that it was a second nose, which was hanging fast to her own. Then she began to scream and howl, but that did no good; she was forced to see it always on her nose, for it stretched out so far. Then she ran out and screamed without stopping till she met St. Joseph, at whose feet she fell and begged until, out of pity, he took the nose off her again, and even gave her two farthings. When she got home, her mother was standing before the door, and asked, \"What hast thou had given to thee?\" Then she lied and said, \"A great bag of money, but I have lost it on the way.\" - \"Lost it!\" cried the mother, \"oh, but we will soon find it again,\" and took her by the hand, and wanted to seek it with her. At first she began to cry, and did not wish to go, but at last she went. On the way, however, so many lizards and snakes broke loose on both of them, that they did not know how to save themselves. At last they stung the wicked child to death, and they stung the mother in the foot, because she had not brought her up better.</string>
    <string name="story430text">There was once on a time a little girl whose father and mother were dead, and she was so poor that she no longer had any little room to live in, or bed to sleep in, and at last she had nothing else but the clothes she was wearing and a little bit of bread in her hand which some charitable soul had given her. She was, however, good and pious. And as she was thus forsaken by all the world, she went forth into the open country, trusting in the good God.\n\nThen a poor man met her, who said: \"Ah, give me something to eat, I am so hungry!\" She reached him the whole of her piece of bread, and said: \"May God bless it to thy use,\" and went onwards. Then came a child who moaned and said: \"My head is so cold, give me something to cover it with.\" So she took off her hood and gave it to him; and when she had walked a little farther, she met another child who had no jacket and was frozen with cold. Then she gave it her own; and a little farther on one begged for a frock, and she gave away that also. At length she got into a forest and it had already become dark, and there came yet another child, and asked for a little shirt, and the good little girl thought to herself: \"It is a dark night and no one sees thee, thou canst very well give thy little shirt away,\" and took it off, and gave away that also.\n\nAnd as she so stood, and had not one single thing left, suddenly some stars from heaven fell down, and they were nothing else but hard smooth pieces of money, and although she had just given her little shirt away, she had a new one which was of the very finest linen. Then she gathered together the money into this, and was rich all the days of her life.</string>
    <string name="story431text">A father was one day sitting at dinner with his wife and his children, and a good friend who had come on a visit was with them. And as they thus sat, and it was striking twelve o\'clock, the stranger saw the door open, and a very pale child dressed in snow-white clothes came in. It did not look around, and it did not speak; but went straight into the next room. Soon afterwards it came back, and went out at the door again in the same quiet manner. On the second and on the third day, it came also exactly in the same way. At last the stranger asked the father to whom the beautiful child that went into the next room every day at noon belonged? \"I have never seen it,\" said he, neither did he know to whom it could belong. The next day when it again came, the stranger pointed it out to the father, who however did not see it, and the mother and the children also all saw nothing. On this the stranger got up, went to the room door, opened it a little, and peeped in. Then he saw the child sitting on the ground, and digging and seeking about industriously amongst the crevices between the boards of the floor, but when it saw the stranger, it disappeared. He now told what he had seen and described the child exactly, and the mother recognized it, and said, \"Ah, it is my dear child who died a month ago.\" They took up the boards and found two farthings which the child had once received from its mother that it might give them to a poor man; it, however, had thought, \"Thou canst buy thyself a biscuit for that,\" and had kept the farthings, and hidden them in the openings between the boards; and therefore it had had no rest in its grave, and had come every day at noon to seek for these farthings. The parents gave the money at once to a poor man, and after that the child was never seen again.\n</string>
    <string name="story432text">There was once a little child whose mother gave her every afternoon a small bowl of milk and bread, and the child seated herself in the yard with it. When she began to eat however, a snake came creeping out of a crevice in the wall, dipped its little head in the dish, and ate with her. The child had pleasure in this, and when she was sitting there with her little dish and the snake did not come at once, she cried,\n\n\"Snake, snake, come swiftly\nHither come, thou tiny thing,\nThou shalt have thy crumbs of bread,\nThou shalt refresh thyself with milk.\"\n\nThen the snake came in haste, and enjoyed its food. Moreover it showed gratitude, for it brought the child all kinds of pretty things from its hidden treasures, bright stones, pearls, and golden playthings. The snake, however, only drank the milk, and left the bread-crumbs alone. Then one day the child took its little spoon and struck the snake gently on its head with it, and said, \"Eat the bread-crumbs as well, little thing.\" The mother, who was standing in the kitchen, heard the child talking to someone, and when she saw that she was striking a snake with her spoon, ran out with a log of wood, and killed the good little creature.\nFrom that time forth, a change came over the child. As long as the snake had eaten with her, she had grown tall and strong, but now she lost her pretty rosy cheeks and wasted away. It was not long before the funeral bird began to cry in the night, and the redbreast to collect little branches and leaves for a funeral garland, and soon afterwards the child lay on her bier.\n\nSecond Story.\n\nAn orphan child was sitting on the town walls spinning, when she saw a snake coming out of a hole low down in the wall. Swiftly she spread out beside this one of the blue silk handkerchiefs which snakes have such a strong liking for, and which are the only things they will creep on. As soon as the snake saw it, it went back, then returned, bringing with it a small golden crown, laid it on the handkerchief, and then went away again. The girl took up the crown, it glittered and was of delicate golden filagree work. It was not long before the snake came back for the second time, but when it no longer saw the crown, it crept up to the wall, and in its grief smote its little head against it as long as it had strength to do so, until at last it lay there dead. If the girl had but left the crown where it was, the snake would certainly have brought still more of its treasures out of the hole.\n\nThird Story.\n\nA snake cries, \"Huhu, huhu.\" A child says, \"Come out.\" The snake comes out, then the child inquires about her little sister: \"Hast thou not seen little Red-stockings?\" The snake says, \"No.\" - \"Neither have I.\" - \"Then I am like you. Huhu, huhu, huhu.\"</string>
    <string name="story433text">A certain father had two sons, the elder of whom was smart and sensible, and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said, \"There\'s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!\" When anything had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal place, he answered \"Oh, no, father, I\'ll not go there, it makes me shudder!\" for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at night which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said \"Oh, it makes us shudder!\" The younger sat in a corner and listened with the rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean. \"They are always saying \'it makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!\' It does not make me shudder,\" thought he. \"That, too, must be an art of which I understand nothing.\"\n\nNow it came to pass that his father said to him one day \"Hearken to me, thou fellow in the corner there, thou art growing tall and strong, and thou too must learn something by which thou canst earn thy living. Look how thy brother works, but thou dost not even earn thy salt.\" - \"Well, father,\" he replied, \"I am quite willing to learn something - indeed, if it could but be managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don\'t understand that at all yet.\" The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and thought to himself, \"Good God, what a blockhead that brother of mine is! He will never be good for anything as long as he lives. He who wants to be a sickle must bend himself betimes.\" The father sighed, and answered him \"thou shalt soon learn what it is to shudder, but thou wilt not earn thy bread by that.\"\n\nSoon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. \"Just think,\" said he, \"when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he actually wanted to learn to shudder.\" - \"If that be all,\" replied the sexton, \"he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon polish him.\" The father was glad to do it, for he thought, \"It will train the boy a little.\" The sexton therefore took him into his house, and he had to ring the bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke him at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and ring the bell. \"Thou shalt soon learn what shuddering is,\" thought he, and secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of the tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell rope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding hole. \"Who is there?\" cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did not move or stir. \"Give an answer,\" cried the boy, \"or take thy self off, thou hast no business here at night.\" The sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might think he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time, \"What do you want here? - speak if thou art an honest fellow, or I will throw thee down the steps!\" The sexton thought, \"he can\'t intend to be as bad as his words,\" uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy called to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose, he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell down ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and fell asleep. The sexton\'s wife waited a long time for her husband, but he did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy, and asked, \"Dost thou not know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower before thou didst.\" - \"No, I don\'t know,\" replied the boy, \"but some one was standing by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he would neither give an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel, and threw him downstairs, just go there and you will see if it was he. I should be sorry if it were.\" The woman ran away and found her husband, who was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg.\n\nShe carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy\'s father. \"Your boy,\" cried she, \"has been the cause of a great misfortune! He has thrown my husband down the steps and made him break his leg. Take the good-for-nothing fellow away from our house.\" The father was terrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. \"What wicked tricks are these?\" said he, \"the devil must have put this into thy head.\" - \"Father,\" he replied, \"do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was standing there by night like one who is intending to do some evil. I did not know who it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go away.\" - \"Ah,\" said the father, \"I have nothing but unhappiness with you. Go out of my sight. I will see thee no more.\" - \"Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I go forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate, understand one art which will support me.\" - \"Learn what thou wilt,\" spake the father, \"it is all the same to me. Here are fifty thalers for thee. Take these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence thou comest, and who is thy father, for I have reason to be ashamed of thee.\" - \"Yes, father, it shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than that, I can easily keep it in mind.\"\n\nWhen day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty thalers into his pocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to himself, \"If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!\" Then a man approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could see the gallows, the man said to him, \"Look, there is the tree where seven men have married the ropemaker\'s daughter, and are now learning how to fly. Sit down below it, and wait till night comes, and you will soon learn how to shudder.\" - \"If that is all that is wanted,\" answered the youth, \"it is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as that, thou shalt have my fifty thalers. Just come back to me early in the morning.\" Then the youth went to the gallows, sat down below it, and waited till evening came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire, but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he could not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each other, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself \"Thou shiverest below by the fire, but how those up above must freeze and suffer!\" And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed up, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven. Then he stirred the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm themselves. But they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught their clothes. So he said, \"Take care, or I will hang you up again.\" The dead men, however, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their rags go on burning. On this he grew angry, and said, \"If you will not take care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,\" and he hung them up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell asleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have the fifty thalers, and said, \"Well, dost thou know how to shudder?\" - \"No,\" answered he, \"how was I to get to know? Those fellows up there did not open their mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which they had on their bodies get burnt.\" Then the man saw that he would not get the fifty thalers that day, and went away saying, \"One of this kind has never come my way before.\"\n\nThe youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to himself, \"Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!\" A waggoner who was striding behind him heard that and asked, \"Who are you?\" - \"I don\'t know,\" answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked, \"From whence comest thou?\" - \"I know not.\" - \"Who is thy father?\" - \"That I may not tell thee.\" - \"What is it that thou art always muttering between thy teeth.\" - \"Ah,\" replied the youth, \"I do so wish I could shudder, but no one can teach me how to do it.\" - \"Give up thy foolish chatter,\" said the waggoner. \"Come, go with me, I will see about a place for thee.\" The youth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn where they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the room the youth again said quite loudly, \"If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!\" The host who heard this, laughed and said, \"If that is your desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.\" - \"Ah, be silent,\" said the hostess, \"so many inquisitive persons have already lost their lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as these should never see the daylight again.\" But the youth said, \"However difficult it may be, I will learn it and for this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.\" He let the host have no rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a haunted castle where any one could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but watch in it for three nights. The King had promised that he who would venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the most beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Great treasures likewise lay in the castle, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would then be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men had gone into the castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the youth went next morning to the King and said if he were allowed he would watch three nights in the haunted castle. The King looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said, \"Thou mayest ask for three things to take into the castle with thee, but they must be things without life.\" Then he answered, \"Then I ask for a fire, a turning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.\"\n\nThe King had these things carried into the castle for him during the day. When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself a bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife beside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe. \"Ah, if I could but shudder!\" said he, \"but I shall not learn it here either.\" Towards midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it, something cried suddenly from one corner, \"Au, miau! how cold we are!\" - \"You simpletons!\" cried he, \"what are you crying about? If you are cold, come and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.\" And when he had said that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down on each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery eyes. After a short time, when they had warmed themselves, they said, \"Comrade, shall we have a game at cards?\" - \"Why not?\" he replied, \"but just show me your paws.\" Then they stretched out their claws. \"Oh,\" said he, \"what long nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for you.\" Thereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board and screwed their feet fast. \"I have looked at your fingers,\" said he, \"and my fancy for card-playing has gone,\" and he struck them dead and threw them out into the water. But when he had made away with these two, and was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and corner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more and more of them came until he could no longer stir, and they yelled horribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put it out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were going too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried, \"Away with ye, vermin,\" and began to cut them down. Part of them ran away, the others he killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he fanned the embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus sat, his eyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner. \"That is the very thing for me,\" said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut his eyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over the whole of the castle. \"That\'s right,\" said he, \"but go faster.\" Then the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down, over thresholds and steps, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside down, and lay on him like a mountain.\n\nBut he threw quilts and pillows up in the air, got out and said, \"Now any one who likes, may drive,\" and lay down by his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the King came, and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil spirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he, \"After all it is a pity, he is a handsome man.\" The youth heard it, got up, and said, \"It has not come to that yet.\" Then the King was astonished, but very glad, and asked how he had fared. \"Very well indeed,\" answered he; \"one night is past, the two others will get over likewise.\" Then he went to the innkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said, \"I never expected to see thee alive again! Hast thou learnt how to shudder yet?\" - \"No,\" said he, \"it is all in vain. If some one would but tell me.\"\n\nThe second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the fire, and once more began his old song, \"If I could but shudder.\" When midnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at first it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for awhile, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the chimney and fell before him. \"Hollo!\" cried he, \"another half belongs to this. This is too little!\" Then the uproar began again, there was a roaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. \"Wait,\" said he, \"I will just blow up the fire a little for thee.\" When he had done that and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a frightful man was sitting in his place. \"That is no part of our bargain,\" said the youth, \"the bench is mine.\" The man wanted to push him away; the youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all his strength, and seated himself again in his own place. Then still more men fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead men\'s legs and two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins with them. The youth also wanted to play and said \"Hark you, can I join you?\" - \"Yes, if thou hast any money.\" - \"Money enough,\" replied he, \"but your balls are not quite round.\" Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and turned them till they were round. \"There, now, they will roll better!\" said he. \"Hurrah! Now it goes merrily!\" He played with them and lost some of his money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his sight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the King came to inquire after him. \"How has it fared with you this time?\" asked he. \"I have been playing at nine-pins,\" he answered, \"and have lost a couple of farthings.\" - \"Hast thou not shuddered then?\" - \"Eh, what?\" said he, \"I have made merry. If I did but know what it was to shudder!\"\n\nThe third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly, \"If I could but shudder.\" When it grew late, six tall men came in and brought a coffin. Then said he, \"Ha, ha, that is certainly my little cousin, who died only a few days ago,\" and he beckoned with his finger, and cried \"Come, little cousin, come.\" They placed the coffin on the ground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay therein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. \"Stop,\" said he, \"I will warm thee a little,\" and went to the fire and warmed his hand and laid it on the dead man\'s face, but he remained cold. Then he took him out, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his arms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good, he thought to himself \"When two people lie in bed together, they warm each other,\" and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down by him. After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began to move. Then said the youth, \"See, little cousin, have I not warmed thee?\" The dead man, however, got up and cried, \"Now will I strangle thee.\" - \"What!\" said he, \"is that the way thou thankest me? Thou shalt at once go into thy coffin again,\" and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut the lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. \"I cannot manage to shudder,\" said he. \"I shall never learn it here as long as I live.\"\n\nThen a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible. He was old, however, and had a long white beard. \"Thou wretch,\" cried he, \"thou shalt soon learn what it is to shudder, for thou shalt die.\" - \"Not so fast,\" replied the youth. \"If I am to die, I shall have to have a say in it.\" - \"I will soon seize thee,\" said the fiend. \"Softly, softly, do not talk so big. I am as strong as thou art, and perhaps even stronger.\" - \"We shall see,\" said the old man. \"If thou art stronger, I will let thee go - come, we will try.\" Then he led him by dark passages to a smith\'s forge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground. \"I can do better than that,\" said the youth, and went to the other anvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his white beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil with one blow, and struck the old man\'s beard in with it. \"Now I have thee,\" said the youth. \"Now it is thou who will have to die.\" Then he seized an iron bar and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, and he would give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go. The old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him three chests full of gold. \"Of these,\" said he, \"one part is for the poor, the other for the king, the third is thine.\" In the meantime it struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared; the youth, therefore, was left in darkness. \"I shall still be able to find my way out,\" said he, and felt about, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire. Next morning the King came and said \"Now thou must have learnt what shuddering is?\" - \"No,\" he answered; \"what can it be? My dead cousin was here, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down below, but no one told me what it was to shudder.\" - \"Then,\" said the King, \"thou hast delivered the castle, and shalt marry my daughter.\" - \"That is all very well,\" said he, \"but still I do not know what it is to shudder.\"\n\nThen the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever much the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still said always \"If I could but shudder - if I could but shudder.\" And at last she was angry at this. Her waiting-maid said, \"I will find a cure for him; he shall soon learn what it is to shudder.\" She went out to the stream which flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons brought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucketful of cold water with the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would sprawl about him. When this was done, he woke up and cried \"Oh, what makes me shudder so? What makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is to shudder!\"</string>
    <string name="story434text">An old woman lived in a village. She had gathered a serving of beans and wanted to cook them, so she prepared a fire in her fireplace. To make it burn faster she lit it with a handful of straw. While she was pouring the beans into the pot, one of them fell unnoticed to the floor, coming to rest next to a piece of straw. Soon afterward a glowing coal jumped out of the fireplace and landed next to them. The straw said, \"Dear friends, where do you come from?\" The coal answered, \"I jumped from the fireplace, to my good fortune. If I had not forced my way out, I surely would have died. I would have burned to ash.\" The bean said, \"I too saved my skin. If the old woman had gotten me into the pot I would have been cooked to mush without mercy, just like my comrades.\" - \"Would my fate have been any better?\" said the straw. \"The old woman sent all my brothers up in fire and smoke. She grabbed sixty at once and killed them. Fortunately I slipped through her fingers.\" - \"What should we do now?\" asked the coal. \"Because we have so fortunately escaped death,\" answered the bean, \"I think that we should join together as comrades. To prevent some new misfortune from befalling us here, let us together make our way to another land.\"\n\nThis proposal pleased the other two, and they set forth all together. They soon came to a small brook, and because there was neither a bridge nor a walkway there, they did not know how they would get across it. Then the straw had a good idea, and said, \"I will lay myself across it, and you can walk across me like on a bridge.\" So the straw stretched himself from one bank to the other. The coal, who was a hot-headed fellow, stepped brashly onto the newly constructed bridge, but when he got to the middle and heard the water rushing beneath him, he took fright, stopped, and did not dare to go any further. Then the straw caught fire, broke into two pieces, and fell into the brook. The coal slid after him, hissed as he fell into the water, and gave up the ghost. The bean who had cautiously stayed behind on the bank had to laugh at the event. He could not stop, and he laughed so fiercely that he burst. Now he too would have died, but fortunately a wandering tailor was there, resting near the brook. Having a compassionate heart, he got out a needle and thread and sewed the bean back together. The bean thanked him most kindly. However, because he had used black thread, since that time all beans have had a black seam.</string>
    <string name="story435text">There were once a man and a woman who had an only child, and lived quite alone in a solitary valley. It came to pass that the mother once went into the wood to gather branches of fir, and took with her little Hans, who was just two years old. As it was spring-time, and the child took pleasure in the many-coloured flowers, she went still further onwards with him into the forest. Suddenly two robbers sprang out of the thicket, seized the mother and child, and carried them far away into the black forest, where no one ever came from one year\'s end to another. The poor woman urgently begged the robbers to set her and her child free, but their hearts were made of stone, they would not listen to her prayers and entreaties, and drove her on farther by force. After they had worked their way through bushes and briars for about two miles, they came to a rock where there was a door, at which the robbers knocked and it opened at once. They had to go through a long dark passage, and at last came into a great cavern, which was lighted by a fire which burnt on the hearth. On the wall hung swords, sabres, and other deadly weapons which gleamed in the light, and in the midst stood a black table at which four other robbers were sitting gambling, and the captain sat at the head of it. As soon as he saw the woman he came and spoke to her, and told her to be at ease and have no fear, they would do nothing to hurt her, but she must look after the house-keeping, and if she kept everything in order, she should not fare ill with them. Thereupon they gave her something to eat, and showed her a bed where she might sleep with her child.\nThe woman stayed many years with the robbers, and Hans grew tall and strong. His mother told him stories, and taught him to read an old book of tales about knights which she found in the cave. When Hans was nine years old, he made himself a strong club out of a branch of fir, hid it behind the bed, and then went to his mother and said, \"Dear mother, pray tell me who is my father; I must and will know.\" His mother was silent and would not tell him, that he might not become home-sick; moreover she knew that the godless robbers would not let him go away, but it almost broke her heart that Hans should not go to his father. In the night, when the robbers came home from their robbing expedition, Hans brought out his club, stood before the captain, and said, \"I now wish to know who is my father, and if thou dost not at once tell me I will strike thee down.\" Then the captain laughed, and gave Hans such a box on the ear that he rolled under the table. Hans got up again, held his tongue, and thought, \"I will wait another year and then try again, perhaps I shall do better then.\" When the year was over, he brought out his club again, rubbed the dust off it, looked at it well, and said, \"It is a stout strong club.\" At night the robbers came home, drank one jug of wine after another, and their heads began to be heavy. Then Hans brought out his club, placed himself before the captain, and asked him who was his father? But the captain again gave him such a vigorous box on the ear that Hans rolled under the table, but it was not long before he was up again, and beat the captain and the robbers so with his club, that they could no longer move either their arms or their legs. His mother stood in a corner full of admiration of his bravery and strength. When Hans had done his work, he went to his mother, and said, \"Now I have shown myself to be in earnest, but now I must also know who is my father.\" - \"Dear Hans,\" answered the mother, \"come, we will go and seek him until we find him.\" She took from the captain the key to the entrance-door, and Hans fetched a great meal-sack and packed into it gold and silver, and whatsoever else he could find that was beautiful, until it was full, and then he took it on his back. They left the cave, but how Hans did open his eyes when he came out of the darkness into daylight, and saw the green forest, and the flowers, and the birds, and the morning sun in the sky. He stood there and wondered at everything just as if he had not been very wise. His mother looked for the way home, and when they had walked for a couple of hours, they got safely into their lonely valley and to their little house. The father was sitting in the doorway. He wept for joy when he recognized his wife and heard that Hans was his son, for he had long regarded them both as dead. But Hans, although he was not twelve years old, was a head taller than his father. They went into the little room together, but Hans had scarcely put his sack on the bench by the stove, than the whole house began to crack the bench broke down and then the floor, and the heavy sack fell through into the cellar. \"God save us!\" cried the father, \"what\'s that? Now thou hast broken our little house to pieces!\" - \"Don\'t grow any grey hairs about that, dear father,\" answered Hans; \"there, in that sack, is more than is wanting for a new house.\" The father and Hans at once began to build a new house; to buy cattle and land, and to keep a farm. Hans ploughed the fields, and when he followed the plough and pushed it into the ground, the bullocks had scarcely any need to draw. The next spring, Hans said, \"Keep all the money and get a walking-stick that weighs a hundred-weight made for me that I may go a-travelling.\" When the wished-for stick was ready, he left his father\'s house, went forth, and came to a deep, dark forest. There he heard something crunching and cracking, looked round, and saw a fir-tree which was wound round like a rope from the bottom to the top, and when he looked upwards he saw a great fellow who had laid hold of the tree and was twisting it like a willow-wand. \"Hollo!\" cried Hans, \"what art thou doing up there?\" the fellow replied, \"I got some faggots together yesterday and am twisting a rope for them.\" - \"That is what I like,\" thought Hans, \"he has some strength,\" and he called to him, \"Leave that alone, and come with me.\" The fellow came down, and he was taller by a whole head than Hans, and Hans was not little. \"Thy name is now Fir-twister,\" said Hans to him. Thereupon they went further and heard something knocking and hammering with such force that the ground shook at every stroke. Shortly afterwards they came to a mighty rock, before which a giant was standing and striking great pieces of it away with his fist. When Hans asked what he was about, he answered, \"At night, when I want to sleep, bears, wolves, and other vermin of that kind come, which sniff and snuffle about me and won\'t let me rest; so I want to build myself a house and lay myself inside it, so that I may have some peace.\" - \"Oh, indeed,\" thought Hans, \"I can make use of this one also;\" and said to him, \"Leave thy house-building alone, and go with me; thou shalt be called Rock-splitter.\" The man consented, and they all three roamed through the forest, and wherever they went the wild beasts were terrified, and ran away from them. In the evening they came to an old deserted castle, went up into it, and laid themselves down in the hall to sleep. The next morning Hans went into the garden. It had run quite wild, and was full of thorns and bushes. And as he was thus walking round about, a wild boar rushed at him; he, however, gave it such a blow with his club that it fell directly. He took it on his shoulders and carried it in, and they put it on a spit, roasted it, and enjoyed themselves. Then they arranged that each day, in turn, two should go out hunting, and one should stay at home, and cook nine pounds of meat for each of them. Fir-twister stayed at home the first, and Hans and Rock-splitter went out hunting. When Fir-twister was busy cooking, a little shrivelled-up old mannikin came to him in the castle, and asked for some meat. \"Be off, sly hypocrite,\" he answered, \"thou needest no meat.\" But how astonished Fir-twister was when the little insignificant dwarf sprang up at him, and belaboured him so with his fists that he could not defend himself, but fell on the ground and gasped for breath! The dwarf did not go away until he had thoroughly vented his anger on him. When the two others came home from hunting, Fir-twister said nothing to them of the old mannikin and of the blows which he himself had received, and thought, \"When they stay at home, they may just try their chance with the little scrubbing-brush;\" and the mere thought of that gave him pleasure already.\n\nThe next day Rock-splitter stayed at home, and he fared just as Fir-twister had done, he was very ill-treated by the dwarf because he was not willing to give him any meat. When the others came home in the evening, Fir-twister easily saw what he had suffered, but both kept silence, and thought, \"Hans also must taste some of that soup.\"\n\nHans, who had to stay at home the next day, did his work in the kitchen as it had to be done, and as he was standing skimming the pan, the dwarf came and without more ado demanded a bit of meat. Then Hans thought, \"He is a poor wretch, I will give him some of my share, that the others may not run short,\" and handed him a bit. When the dwarf had devoured it, he again asked for some meat, and good-natured Hans gave it to him, and told him it was a handsome piece, and that he was to be content with it. But the dwarf begged again for the third time. \"Thou art shameless!\" said Hans, and gave him none. Then the malicious dwarf wanted to spring on him and treat him as he had treated Fir-twister and Rock-splitter, but he had got to the wrong man. Hans, without exerting himself much, gave him a couple of blows which made him jump down the castle steps. Hans was about to run after him, but fell right over him, for he was so tall. When he rose up again, the dwarf had got the start of him. Hans hurried after him as far as the forest, and saw him slip into a hole in the rock. Hans now went home, but he had marked the spot. When the two others came back, they were surprised that Hans was so well. He told them what had happened, and then they no longer concealed how it had fared with them. Hans laughed and said, \"It served you quite right; why were you so greedy with your meat? It is a disgrace that you who are so big should have let yourselves be beaten by the dwarf.\" Thereupon they took a basket and a rope, and all three went to the hole in the rock into which the dwarf had slipped, and let Hans and his club down in the basket. When Hans had reached the bottom, he found a door, and when he opened it a maiden was sitting there who was lovely as any picture, nay, so beautiful that no words can express it, and by her side sat the dwarf and grinned at Hans like a sea-cat! She, however, was bound with chains, and looked so mournfully at him that Hans felt great pity for her, and thought to himself, \"Thou must deliver her out of the power of the wicked dwarf,\" and gave him such a blow with his club that he fell down dead. Immediately the chains fell from the maiden, and Hans was enraptured with her beauty. She told him she was a King\'s daughter whom a savage count had stolen away from her home, and imprisoned there among the rocks, because she would have nothing to say to him. The count had, however, set the dwarf as a watchman, and he had made her bear misery and vexation enough. And now Hans placed the maiden in the basket and had her drawn up; the basket came down again, but Hans did not trust his two companions, and thought, \"They have already shown themselves to be false, and told me nothing about the dwarf; who knows what design they may have against me?\" So he put his club in the basket, and it was lucky he did; for when the basket was half-way up, they let it fall again, and if Hans had really been sitting in it he would have been killed. But now he did not know how he was to work his way out of the depths, and when he turned it over and over in his mind he found no counsel. \"It is indeed sad,\" said he to himself, \"that I have to waste away down here,\" and as he was thus walking backwards and forwards, he once more came to the little chamber where the maiden had been sitting, and saw that the dwarf had a ring on his finger which shone and sparkled. Then he drew it off and put it on, and when he turned it round on his finger, he suddenly heard something rustle over his head. He looked up and saw spirits of the air hovering above, who told him he was their master, and asked what his desire might be? Hans was at first struck dumb, but afterwards he said that they were to carry him above again. They obeyed instantly, and it was just as if he had flown up himself. When, however, he was above again, he found no one in sight. Fir-twister and Rock-splitter had hurried away, and had taken the beautiful maiden with them. But Hans turned the ring, and the spirits of the air came and told him that the two were on the sea. Hans ran and ran without stopping, until he came to the sea-shore, and there far, far out on the water, he perceived a little boat in which his faithless comrades were sitting; and in fierce anger he leapt, without thinking what he was doing, club in hand into the water, and began to swim, but the club, which weighed a hundredweight, dragged him deep down until he was all but drowned. Then in the very nick of time he turned his ring, and immediately the spirits of the air came and bore him as swift as lightning into the boat. He swung his club and gave his wicked comrades the reward they merited and threw them into the water, and then he sailed with the beautiful maiden, who had been in the greatest alarm, and whom he delivered for the second time, home to her father and mother, and married her, and all rejoiced exceedingly.</string>
    <string name="story436text">There was a poor but good little girl who lived alone with her mother, and they no longer had anything to eat. So the child went into the forest, and there an aged woman met her who was aware of her sorrow, and presented her with a little pot, which when she said, \"Cook, little pot, cook,\" would cook good, sweet porridge, and when she said, \"Stop, little pot,\" it ceased to cook. The girl took the pot home to her mother, and now they were freed from their poverty and hunger, and ate sweet porridge as often as they chose. Once on a time when the girl had gone out, her mother said, \"Cook, little pot, cook.\" And it did cook and she ate till she was satisfied, and then she wanted the pot to stop cooking, but did not know the word. So it went on cooking and the porridge rose over the edge, and still it cooked on until the kitchen and whole house were full, and then the next house, and then the whole street, just as if it wanted to satisfy the hunger of the whole world, and there was the greatest distress, but no one knew how to stop it. At last when only one single house remained, the child came home and just said, \"Stop, little pot,\" and it stopped and gave up cooking, and whosoever wished to return to the town had to eat his way back.</string>
    <string name="story437text">One very fine day it came to pass that the good God wished to enjoy himself in the heavenly garden, and took all the apostles and saints with him, so that no one stayed in heaven but Saint Peter. The Lord had commanded him to let no one in during his absence, so Peter stood by the door and kept watch. Before long some one knocked. Peter asked who was there, and what he wanted? \"I am a poor, honest tailor who prays for admission,\" replied a smooth voice. \"Honest indeed,\" said Peter, \"like the thief on the gallows! Thou hast been light-fingered and hast snipped folks\' clothes away. Thou wilt not get into heaven. The Lord hath forbidden me to let any one in while he is out.\" - \"Come, do be merciful,\" cried the tailor. \"Little scraps which fall off the table of their own accord are not stolen, and are not worth speaking about. Look, I am lame, and have blisters on my feet with walking here, I cannot possibly turn back again. Only let me in, and I will do all the rough work. I will carry the children, and wash their clothes, and wash and clean the benches on which they have been playing, and patch all their torn clothes.\" Saint Peter let himself be moved by pity, and opened the door of heaven just wide enough for the lame tailor to slip his lean body in. He was forced to sit down in a corner behind the door, and was to stay quietly and peaceably there, in order that the Lord, when he returned, might not observe him and be angry. The tailor obeyed, but once when Saint Peter went outside the door, he got up, and full of curiosity, went round about into every corner of heaven, and inspected the arrangement of every place. At length he came to a spot where many beautiful and delightful chairs were standing, and in the midst was a seat all of gold which was set with shining jewels, likewise it was much higher than the other chairs, and a footstool of gold was before it. It was, however, the seat on which the Lord sat when he was at home, and from which he could see everything which happened on earth. The tailor stood still, and looked at the seat for a long time, for it pleased him better than all else. At last he could master his curiosity no longer, and climbed up and seated himself in the chair. Then he saw everything which was happening on earth, and observed an ugly old woman who was standing washing by the side of a stream, secretly laying two veils on one side for herself. The sight of this made the tailor so angry that he laid hold of the golden footstool, and threw it down to earth through heaven, at the old thief. As, however, he could not bring the stool back again, he slipped quietly out of the chair, seated himself in his place behind the door, and behaved as if he had never stirred from the spot.\nWhen the Lord and master came back again with his heavenly companions, he did not see the tailor behind the door, but when he seated himself on his chair the footstool was missing. He asked Saint Peter what had become of the stool, but he did not know. Then he asked if he had let anyone come in. \"I know of no one who has been here,\" answered Peter, \"but a lame tailor, who is still sitting behind the door.\" Then the Lord had the tailor brought before him, and asked him if he had taken away the stool, and where he had put it? \"Oh, Lord,\" answered the tailor joyously, \"I threw it in my anger down to earth at an old woman whom I saw stealing two veils at the washing.\" - \"Oh, thou knave,\" said the Lord, \"were I to judge as thou judgest, how dost thou think thou couldst have escaped so long? I should long ago have had no chairs, benches, seats, nay, not even an oven-fork, but should have thrown everything down at the sinners. Henceforth thou canst stay no longer in heaven, but must go outside the door again. Then go where thou wilt. No one shall give punishment here, but I alone, the Lord.\"\n\nPeter was obliged to take the tailor out of heaven again, and as he had torn shoes, and feet covered with blisters, he took a stick in his hand, and went to \"Wait-a-bit,\" where the good soldiers sit and make merry.</string>
    <string name="story438text">Hans wished to put his son to learn a trade, so he went into the church and prayed to our Lord God to know which would be most advantageous for him. Then the clerk got behind the altar, and said, \"Thieving, thieving.\" On this Hans goes back to his son, and tells him he is to learn thieving, and that the Lord God had said so. So he goes with his son to seek a man who is acquainted with thieving. They walk a long time and come into a great forest, where stands a little house with an old woman in it. Hans says, \"Do you know of a man who is acquainted with thieving?\" - \"You can learn that here quite well,\" says the woman, \"my son is a master of it.\" So he speaks with the son, and asks if he knows thieving really well? The master-thief says, \"I will teach him well. Come back when a year is over, and then if you recognize your son, I will take no payment at all for teaching him; but if you don\'t know him, you must give me two hundred thalers.\"\nThe father goes home again, and the son learns witchcraft and thieving, thoroughly. When the year is out, the father is full of anxiety to know how he is to contrive to recognize his son. As he is thus going about in his trouble, he meets a little dwarf, who says, \"Man, what ails you, that you are always in such trouble?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" says Hans, \"a year ago I placed my son with a master-thief who told me I was to come back when the year was out, and that if I then did not know my son when I saw him, I was to pay two hundred thalers; but if I did know him I was to pay nothing, and now I am afraid of not knowing him and can\'t tell where I am to get the money.\" Then the dwarf tells him to take a small basket of bread with him, and to stand beneath the chimney. \"There on the cross-beam is a basket, out of which a little bird is peeping, and that is your son.\"\n\nHans goes thither, and throws a little basket full of black bread in front of the basket with the bird in it, and the little bird comes out, and looks up. \"Hollo, my son, art thou here?\" says the father, and the son is delighted to see his father, but the master-thief says, \"The devil must have prompted you, or how could you have known your son?\" - \"Father, let us go,\" said the youth.\n\nThen the father and son set out homeward. On the way a carriage comes driving by. Hereupon the son says to his father, \"I will change myself into a large greyhound, and then you can earn a great deal of money by me.\" Then the gentleman calls from the carriage, \"My man, will you sell your dog?\" - \"Yes,\" says the father. \"How much do you want for it?\" - \"Thirty thalers.\" - \"Eh, man, that is a great deal, but as it is such a very fine dog I will have it.\" The gentleman takes it into his carriage, but when they have driven a little farther the dog springs out of the carriage through the window, and goes back to his father, and is no longer a greyhound.\n\nThey go home together. Next day there is a fair in the neighboring town, so the youth says to his father, \"I will now change myself into a beautiful horse, and you can sell me; but when you have sold me, you must take off my bridle, or I cannot become a man again.\" Then the father goes with the horse to the fair, and the master-thief comes and buys the horse for a hundred thalers, but the father forgets, and does not take off the bridle. So the man goes home with the horse, and puts it in the stable. When the maid crosses the threshold, the horse says, \"Take off my bridle, take off my bridle.\" Then the maid stands still, and says, \"What, canst thou speak?\" So she goes and takes the bridle off, and the horse becomes a sparrow, and flies out at the door, and the wizard becomes a sparrow also, and flies after him. Then they come together and cast lots, but the master loses, and betakes himself to the water and is a fish. Then the youth also becomes a fish, and they cast lots again, and the master loses. So the master changes himself into a cock, and the youth becomes a fox, and bites the master\'s head off, and he died and has remained dead to this day.</string>
    <string name="story439text">There were once three apprentices, who had agreed to keep always together while travelling, and always to work in the same town. At one time, however, their masters had no more work to give them, so that at last they were in rags, and had nothing to live on. Then one of them said, \"What shall we do? We cannot stay here any longer, we will travel once more, and if we do not find any work in the town we go to, we will arrange with the innkeeper there, that we are to write and tell him where we are staying, so that we can always have news of each other, and then we will separate.\" And that seemed best to the others also. They went forth, and met on the way a richly-dressed man who asked who they were. \"We are apprentices looking for work; Up to this time we have kept together, but if we cannot find anything to do we are going to separate.\" - \"There is no need for that,\" said the man, \"if you will do what I tell you, you shall not want for gold or for work; nay, you shall become great lords, and drive in your carriages!\" One of them said, \"If our souls and salvation be not endangered, we will certainly do it.\" - \"They will not,\" replied the man, \"I have no claim on you.\" One of the others had, however, looked at his feet, and when he saw a horse\'s foot and a man\'s foot, he did not want to have anything to do with him. The Devil, however, said, \"Be easy, I have no designs on you, but on another soul, which is half my own already, and whose measure shall but run full.\" As they were now secure, they consented, and the Devil told them what he wanted. The first was to answer, \"All three of us,\" to every question; the second was to say, \"For money,\" and the third, \"And quite right too!\" They were always to say this, one after the other, but they were not to say one word more, and if they disobeyed this order, all their money would disappear at once, but so long as they observed it, their pockets would always be full. As a beginning, he at once gave them as much as they could carry, and told them to go to such and such an inn when they got to the town. They went to it, and the innkeeper came to meet them, and asked if they wished for anything to eat? The first replied, \"All three of us.\" - \"Yes,\" said the host, \"that is what I mean.\" The second said, \"For money.\" - \"Of course,\" said the host. The third said, \"And quite right too!\" - \"Certainly it is right,\" said the host.\nGood meat and drink were now brought to them, and they were well waited on. After the dinner came the payment, and the innkeeper gave the bill to the one who said, \"All three of us,\" the second said, \"For money,\" and the third, \"and quite right too!\" - \"Indeed it is right,\" said the host, \"all three pay, and without money I can give nothing.\" They, however, paid still more than he had asked. The lodgers, who were looking on, said, \"These people must be mad.\" - \"Yes, indeed they are,\" said the host, \"they are not very wise.\" So they stayed some time in the inn, and said nothing else but, \"All three of us,\" - \"For money,\" and \"And quite right too!\" But they saw and knew all that was going on. It so happened that a great merchant came with a large sum of money, and said, \"Sir host, take care of my money for me, here are three crazy apprentices who might steal it from me.\" The host did as he was asked. As he was carrying the trunk into his room, he felt that it was heavy with gold. Thereupon he gave the three apprentices a lodging below, but the merchant came up-stairs into a separate apartment. When it was midnight, and the host thought that all were asleep, he came with his wife, and they had an axe and struck the rich merchant dead; and after they had murdered him they went to bed again. When it was day there was a great outcry; the merchant lay dead in bed bathed in blood. All the guests ran at once but the host said, \"The three crazy apprentices have done this;\" the lodgers confirmed it, and said, \"It can have been no one else.\" The innkeeper, however, had them called, and said to them, \"Have you killed the merchant?\" - \"All three of us,\" said the first, \"For money,\" said the second; and the third added, \"And quite right too!\" - \"There now, you hear,\" said the host, \"they confess it themselves.\" They were taken to prison, therefore, and were to be tried. When they saw that things were going so seriously, they were after all afraid, but at night the Devil came and said, \"Bear it just one day longer, and do not play away your luck, not one hair of your head shall be hurt.\"\n\nThe next morning they were led to the bar, and the judge said, \"Are you the murderers?\" - \"All three of us.\" - \"Why did you kill the merchant?\" - \"For money.\" - \"You wicked wretches, you have no horror of your sins?\" - \"And quite right too!\" - \"They have confessed, and are still stubborn,\" said the judge, \"lead them to death instantly.\" So they were taken out, and the host had to go with them into the circle. When they were taken hold of by the executioner\'s men, and were just going to be led up to the scaffold where the headsman was standing with naked sword, a coach drawn by four blood-red chestnut horses came up suddenly, driving so fast that fire flashed from the stones, and someone made signs from the window with a white handkerchief. Then said the headsman, \"It is a pardon coming,\" and \"Pardon! pardon!\" was called from the carriage also. Then the Devil stepped out as a very noble gentleman, beautifully dressed, and said, \"You three are innocent; you may now speak, make known what you have seen and heard.\" Then said the eldest, \"We did not kill the merchant, the murderer is standing there in the circle,\" and he pointed to the innkeeper. \"In proof of this, go into his cellar, where many others whom he has killed are still hanging.\" Then the judge sent the executioner\'s men thither, and they found it was as the apprentices said, and when they had informed the judge of this, he caused the innkeeper to be led up, and his head was cut off. Then said the Devil to the three, \"Now I have got the soul which I wanted to have, and you are free, and have money for the rest of your lives.\"</string>
    <string name="story440text">Three army-surgeons who thought they knew their art perfectly, were travelling about the world, and they came to an inn where they wanted to pass the night. The host asked whence they came, and whither they were going? \"We are roaming about the world and practising our art.\" - \"Just show me for once in a way what you can do,\" said the host. Then the first said he would cut off his hand, and put it on again early next morning; the second said he would tear out his heart, and replace it next morning; the third said he would cut out his eyes and heal them again next morning. \"If you can do that,\" said the innkeeper, \"you have learnt everything.\" They, however, had a salve, with which they rubbed themselves, which joined parts together, and they carried the little bottle in which it was, constantly with them. Then they cut the hand, heart and eyes from their bodies as they had said they would, and laid them all together on a plate, and gave it to the innkeeper. The innkeeper gave it to a servant who was to set it in the cupboard, and take good care of it. The girl, however, had a lover in secret, who was a soldier. When therefore the innkeeper, the three army-surgeons, and everyone else in the house were asleep, the soldier came and wanted something to eat. The girl opened the cupboard and brought him some food, and in her love forgot to shut the cupboard-door again; She seated herself at the table by her lover, and they chattered away together. While she sat so contentedly there, thinking of no ill luck, the cat came creeping in, found the cupboard open, took the hand and heart and eyes of the three army-surgeons, and ran off with them. When the soldier had done eating, and the girl was taking away the things and going to shut the cupboard she saw that the plate which the innkeeper had given her to take care of, was empty. Then she said in a fright to her lover, \"Ah, miserable girl, what shall I do? The hand is gone, the heart and the eyes are gone too, what will become of me in the morning?\" - \"Be easy,\" said he, \"I will help thee out of thy trouble there is a thief hanging outside on the gallows, I will cut off his hand. Which hand was it?\" - \"The right one.\" Then the girl gave him a sharp knife, and he went and cut the poor sinner\'s right hand off, and brought it to her. After this he caught the cat and cut its eyes out, and now nothing but the heart was wanting. \"Have you not been killing, and are not the dead pigs in the cellar?\" said he. \"Yes,\" said the girl. \"That\'s well,\" said the soldier, and he went down and fetched a pig\'s heart. The girl placed all together on the plate, and put it in the cupboard, and when after this her lover took leave of her, she went quietly to bed.\nIn the morning when the three army-surgeons got up, they told the girl she was to bring them the plate on which the hand, heart, and eyes were lying. Then she brought it out of the cupboard, and the first fixed the thief\'s hand on and smeared it with his salve, and it grew to his arm directly. The second took the cat\'s eyes and put them in his own head. The third fixed the pig\'s heart firm in the place where his own had been, and the innkeeper stood by, admired their skill, and said he had never yet seen such a thing as that done, and would sing their praises and recommend them to everyone. Then they paid their bill, and travelled farther.\n\nAs they were on their way, the one with the pig\'s heart did not stay with them at all, but wherever there was a corner he ran to it, and rooted about in it with his nose as pigs do. The others wanted to hold him back by the tail of his coat, but that did no good; he tore himself loose, and ran wherever the dirt was thickest. The second also behaved very strangely; he rubbed his eyes, and said to the others, \"Comrades, what is the matter? I don\'t see at all. Will one of you lead me, so that I do not fall.\" Then with difficulty they travelled on till evening, when they reached another inn. They went into the bar together, and there at a table in the corner sat a rich man counting money. The one with the thief\'s hand walked round about him, made a sudden movement twice with his arm, and at last when the stranger turned away, he snatched at the pile of money, and took a handful from it. One of them saw this, and said, \"Comrade, what art thou about? Thou must not steal shame on thee!\" - \"Eh,\" said he, \"but how can I stop myself? My hand twitches, and I am forced to snatch things whether I will or not.\"\n\nAfter this, they lay down to sleep, and while they were lying there it was so dark that no one could see his own hand. All at once the one with the cat\'s eyes awoke, aroused the others, and said. \"Brothers, just look up, do you see the white mice running about there?\" The two sat up, but could see nothing. Then said he, \"Things are not right with us, we have not got back again what is ours. We must return to the innkeeper, he has deceived us.\" They went back therefore, the next morning, and told the host they had not got what was their own again; that the first had a thief\'s hand, the second cat\'s eyes, and the third a pig\'s heart. The innkeeper said that the girl must be to blame for that, and was going to call her, but when she had seen the three coming, she had run out by the backdoor, and not come back. Then the three said he must give them a great deal of money, or they would set his house on fire. He gave them what he had, and whatever he could get together, and the three went away with it. It was enough for the rest of their lives, but they would rather have had their own proper organs.\n</string>
    <string name="story441text">East India was besieged by an enemy who would not retire until he had received six hundred dollars. Then the townsfolk caused it to be proclaimed by beat of drum that whosoever was able to procure the money should be burgomaster. Now there was a poor fisherman who fished on the lake with his son, and the enemy came and took the son prisoner, and gave the father six hundred dollars for him. So the father went and gave them to the great men of the town, and the enemy departed, and the fisherman became burgomaster. Then it was proclaimed that whosoever did not say, \"Mr. Burgomaster,\" should be put to death on the gallows.\nThe son got away again from the enemy, and came to a great forest on a high mountain. The mountain opened, and he went into a great enchanted castle, wherein chairs, tables, and benches were all hung with black. Then came three young princesses who were entirely dressed in black, but had a little white on their faces; they told him he was not to be afraid, they would not hurt him, and that he could deliver them. He said he would gladly do that, if he did but know how. At this, they told him he must for a whole year not speak to them and also not look at them, and what he wanted to have he was just to ask for, and if they dared give him an answer they would do so. When he had been there for a long while he said he should like to go to his father, and they told him he might go. He was to take with him this purse with money, put on this coat, and in a week he must be back there again.\n\nThen he was caught up, and was instantly in East India. He could no longer find his father in the fisherman\'s hut, and asked the people where the poor fisherman could be, and they told him he must not say that, or he would come to the gallows. Then he went to his father and said, \"Fisherman, how hast thou got here?\" Then the father said, \"Thou must not say that, if the great men of the town knew of that, thou wouldst come to the gallows.\" He, however, would not stop, and was brought to the gallows. When he was there, he said, \"O, my masters, just give me leave to go to the old fisherman\'s hut.\" Then he put on his old smock-frock, and came back to the great men, and said, \"Do ye not now see? Am I not the son of the poor fisherman? Did I not earn bread for my father and mother in this dress?\" Hereupon his father knew him again, and begged his pardon, and took him home with him, and then he related all that had happened to him, and how he had got into a forest on a high mountain, and the mountain had opened and he had gone into an enchanted castle, where all was black, and three young princesses had come to him who were black except a little white on their faces. And they had told him not to fear, and that he could deliver them. Then his mother said that might very likely not be a good thing to do, and that he ought to take a holy-water vessel with him, and drop some boiling water on their faces.\n\nHe went back again, and he was in great fear, and he dropped the water on their faces as they were sleeping, and they all turned half-white. Then all the three princesses sprang up, and said, \"Thou accursed dog, our blood shall cry for vengeance on thee! Now there is no man born in the world, nor will any ever be born who can set us free! We have still three brothers who are bound by seven chains they shall tear thee to pieces.\" Then there was a loud shrieking all over the castle, and he sprang out of the window, and broke his leg, and the castle sank into the earth again, the mountain shut to again, and no one knew where the castle had stood.</string>
    <string name="story442text">There was once a man who had three sons, and nothing else in the world but the house in which he lived. Now each of the sons wished to have the house after his father\'s death; but the father loved them all alike, and did not know what to do; he did not wish to sell the house, because it had belonged to his forefathers, else he might have divided the money amongst them. At last a plan came into his head, and he said to his sons, \"Go into the world, and try each of you to learn a trade, and, when you all come back, he who makes the best masterpiece shall have the house.\"\nThe sons were well content with this, and the eldest determined to be a blacksmith, the second a barber, and the third a fencing-master. They fixed a time when they should all come home again, and then each went his way.\n\nIt chanced that they all found skilful masters, who taught them their trades well. The blacksmith had to shoe the King\'s horses, and he thought to himself, \"The house is mine, without doubt.\" The barber only shaved great people, and he too already looked upon the house as his own. The fencing-master got many a blow, but he only bit his lip, and let nothing vex him; \"for,\" said he to himself, \"If you are afraid of a blow, you\'ll never win the house.\"\n\nWhen the appointed time had gone by, the three brothers came back home to their father; but they did not know how to find the best opportunity for showing their skill, so they sat down and consulted together. As they were sitting thus, all at once a hare came running across the field. \"Ah, ha, just in time!\" said the barber. So he took his basin and soap, and lathered away until the hare came up; then he soaped and shaved off the hare\'s whiskers whilst he was running at the top of his speed, and did not even cut his skin or injure a hair on his body. \"Well done!\" said the old man. \"your brothers will have to exert themselves wonderfully, or the house will be yours.\"\n\nSoon after, up came a nobleman in his coach, dashing along at full speed. \"Now you shall see what I can do, father,\" said the blacksmith; so away he ran after the coach, took all four shoes off the feet of one of the horses whilst he was galloping, and put him on four new shoes without stopping him. \"You are a fine fellow, and as clever as your brother,\" said his father; \"I do not know to which I ought to give the house.\"\n\nThen the third son said, \"Father, let me have my turn, if you please;\" and, as it was beginning to rain, he drew his sword, and flourished it backwards and forwards above his head so fast that not a drop fell upon him. It rained still harder and harder, till at last it came down in torrents; but he only flourished his sword faster and faster, and remained as dry as if he were sitting in a house. When his father saw this he was amazed, and said, \"This is the master-piece, the house is yours!\"\n\nHis brothers were satisfied with this, as was agreed beforehand; and, as they loved one another very much, they all three stayed together in the house, followed their trades, and, as they had learnt them so well and were so clever, they earned a great deal of money. Thus they lived together happily until they grew old; and at last, when one of them fell sick and died, the two others grieved so sorely about it that they also fell ill, and soon after died. And because they had been so clever, and had loved one another so much, they were all laid in the same grave.</string>
    <string name="story443text">A father once called his three sons before him, and he gave to the first a cock, to the second a scythe, and to the third a cat. \"I am already aged,\" said he, \"my death is nigh, and I have wished to take thought for you before my end; money I have not, and what I now give you seems of little worth, but all depends on your making a sensible use of it. Only seek out a country where such things are still unknown, and your fortune is made.\"\nAfter the father\'s death the eldest went away with his cock, but wherever he came the cock was already known; in the towns he saw him from a long distance, sitting upon the steeples and turning round with the wind, and in the villages he heard more than one crowing; no one would show any wonder at the creature, so that it did not look as if he would make his fortune by it.\n\nAt last, however, it happened that he came to an island where the people knew nothing about cocks, and did not even understand how to divide their time. They certainly knew when it was morning or evening, but at night, if they did not sleep through it, not one of them knew how to find out the time.\n\n\"Look!\" said he, \"what a proud creature! it has a ruby-red crown upon its head, and wears spurs like a knight; it calls you three times during the night, at fixed hours, and when it calls for the last time, the sun soon rises. But if it crows by broad daylight, then take notice, for there will certainly be a change of weather.\"\n\nThe people were well pleased; for a whole night they did not sleep, and listened with great delight as the cock at two, four, and six o\'clock, loudly and clearly proclaimed the time. They asked if the creature were for sale, and how much he wanted for it? \"About as much gold as an ass can carry,\" answered he. \"A ridiculously small price for such a precious creature!\" they cried unanimously, and willingly gave him what he had asked.\n\nWhen he came home with his wealth his brothers were astonished, and the second said, \"Well, I will go forth and see whether I cannot get rid of my scythe as profitably.\" But it did not look as if he would, for labourers met him everywhere, and they had scythes upon their shoulders as well as he.\n\nAt last, however, he chanced upon an island where the people knew nothing of scythes. When the corn was ripe there, they took cannon out to the fields and shot it down. Now this was rather an uncertain affair; many shot right over it, others hit the ears instead of the stems, and shot them away, whereby much was lost, and besides all this, it made a terrible noise. So the man set to work and mowed it down so quietly and quickly that the people opened their mouths with astonishment. They agreed to give him what he wanted for the scythe, and he received a horse laden with as much gold as it could carry.\n\nAnd now the third brother wanted to take his cat to the right man. He fared just like the others; so long as he stayed on the mainland there was nothing to be done. Every place had cats, and there were so many of them that new-born kittens were generally drowned in the ponds.\n\nAt last he sailed over to an island, and it luckily happened that no cats had ever yet been seen there, and that the mice had got the upper hand so much that they danced upon the tables and benches whether the master were at home or not. The people complained bitterly of the plague; the King himself in his palace did not know how to secure himself against them; mice squeaked in every corner, and gnawed whatever they could lay hold of with their teeth. But now the cat began her chase, and soon cleared a couple of rooms, and the people begged the King to buy the wonderful beast for the country. The King willingly gave what was asked, which was a mule laden with gold, and the third brother came home with the greatest treasure of all.\n\nThe cat made herself merry with the mice in the royal palace, and killed so many that they could not be counted. At last she grew warm with the work and thirsty, so she stood still, lifted up her head and cried, \"Mew. Mew!\" When they heard this strange cry, the King and all his people were frightened, and in their terror ran all at once out of the palace. Then the King took counsel what was best to be done; at last it was determined to send a herald to the cat, and demand that she should leave the palace, or if not, she was to expect that force would be used against her. The councillors said, \"Rather will we let ourselves be plagued with the mice, for to that misfortune we are accustomed, than give up our lives to such a monster as this.\" A noble youth, therefore, was sent to ask the cat \"whether she would peaceably quit the castle?\" But the cat, whose thirst had become still greater, merely answered, \"Mew! Mew!\" The youth understood her to say, \"Most certainly not! most certainly not!\" and took this answer to the King. \"Then,\" said the councillors, \"she shall yield to force.\" Cannon were brought out, and the palace was soon in flames. When the fire reached the room where the cat was sitting, she sprang safely out of the window; but the besiegers did not leave off until the whole palace was shot down to the ground.</string>
    <string name="story444text">There was once on a time a King who had three sons, of whom two were clever and wise, but the third did not speak much, and was simple, and was called the Simpleton. When the King had become old and weak, and was thinking of his end, he did not know which of his sons should inherit the kingdom after him. Then he said to them: \"Go forth, and he who brings me the most beautiful carpet shall be King after my death.\" And that there should be no dispute amongst them, he took them outside his castle, blew three feathers in the air, and said: \"You shall go as they fly.\" One feather flew to the east, the other to the west, but the third flew straight up and did not fly far, but soon fell to the ground. And now one brother went to the right, and the other to the left, and they mocked Simpleton, who was forced to stay where the third feather had fallen.\n\nHe sat down and was sad, then all at once he saw that there was a trap-door close by the feather. He raised it up, found some steps, and went down them, and then he came to another door, knocked at it, and heard somebody inside calling:\n\"Little green maiden small,\nHopping,\nHopping hither and thither;\nHop to the door,\nAnd quickly see who is there.\"\nThe door opened, and he saw a great, fat toad sitting, and round about her a crowd of little toads. The fat toad asked what he wanted? He answered: \"I should like to have the prettiest and finest carpet in the world.\" Then she called a young one and said:\n\"Little green maiden small,\nHopping,\nHopping hither and thither,\nHop quickly and bring me\nThe great box here.\"\nThe young toad brought the box, and the fat toad opened it, and gave Simpleton a carpet out of it, so beautiful and so fine, that on the earth above, none could have been woven like it. Then he thanked her, and ascended again.\n\nThe two others had, however, looked on their youngest brother as so stupid that they believed he would find and bring nothing at all. \"Why should we give ourselves a great deal of trouble to search?\" said they, and got some coarse handkerchiefs from the first shepherds\' wives whom they met, and carried them home to the King. At the same time Simpleton also came back, and brought his beautiful carpet, and when the King saw it he was astonished, and said: \"If justice be done, the kingdom belongs to the youngest.\" But the two others let their father have no peace, and said that it was impossible that Simpleton, who in everything lacked understanding, should be King, and entreated him to make a new agreement with them. Then the father said: \"He who brings me the most beautiful ring shall inherit the kingdom,\" and led the three brothers out, and blew into the air three feathers, which they were to follow. Those of the two eldest again went east and west, and Simpleton\'s feather flew straight up, and fell down near the door into the earth. Then he went down again to the fat toad, and told her that he wanted the most beautiful ring. She at once ordered her great box to be brought, and gave him a ring out of it, which sparkled with jewels, and was so beautiful that no goldsmith on earth would have been able to make it. The two eldest laughed at Simpleton for going to seek a golden ring. They gave themselves no trouble, but knocked the nails out of an old carriage-ring, and took it to the King; but when Simpleton produced his golden ring, his father again said, \"The kingdom belongs to him.\" The two eldest did not cease from tormenting the King until he made a third condition, and declared that the one who brought the most beautiful woman home, should have the kingdom. He again blew the three feathers into the air, and they flew as before.\n\nThen Simpleton without more ado went down to the fat toad, and said: \"I am to take home the most beautiful woman!\" - \"Oh,\" answered the toad, \"the most beautiful woman! She is not at hand at the moment, but still thou shalt have her.\" She gave him a yellow turnip which had been hollowed out, to which six mice were harnessed. Then Simpleton said quite mournfully: \"What am I to do with that?\" The toad answered: \"Just put one of my little toads into it.\" Then he seized one at random out of the circle, and put her into the yellow coach, but hardly was she seated inside it than she turned into a wonderfully beautiful maiden, and the turnip into a coach, and the six mice into horses. So he kissed her, and drove off quickly with the horses, and took her to the King. His brothers came afterwards; they had given themselves no trouble at all to seek beautiful girls, but had brought with them the first peasant women they chanced to meet. When the King saw them he said: \"After my death the kingdom belongs to my youngest son.\" But the two eldest deafened the King\'s ears afresh with their clamour, \"We cannot consent to Simpleton\'s being King,\" and demanded that the one whose wife could leap through a ring which hung in the centre of the hall should have the preference. They thought: \"The peasant women can do that easily; they are strong enough, but the delicate maiden will jump herself to death.\" The aged King agreed likewise to this. Then the two peasant women jumped, and jumped through the ring, but were so stout that they fell, and their coarse arms and legs broke in two. And then the pretty maiden whom Simpleton had brought with him, sprang, and sprang through as lightly as a deer, and all opposition had to cease. So he received the crown, and has ruled wisely for a length of time.</string>
    <string name="story445text">There was once on a time a hermit who lived in a forest at the foot of a mountain, and passed his time in prayer and good works, and every evening he carried, to the glory of God, two pails of water up the mountain. Many a beast drank of it, and many a plant was refreshed by it, for on the heights above, a strong wind blew continually, which dried the air and the ground, and the wild birds which dread mankind wheel about there, and with their sharp eyes search for a drink. And because the hermit was so pious, an angel of God, visible to his eyes, went up with him, counted his steps, and when the work was completed, brought him his food, even as the prophet of old was by God\'s command fed by the raven. When the hermit in his piety had already reached a great age, it happened that he once saw from afar a poor sinner being taken to the gallows. He said carelessly to himself, \"There, that one is getting his deserts!\" In the evening, when he was carrying the water up the mountain, the angel who usually accompanied him did not appear, and also brought him no food. Then he was terrified, and searched his heart, and tried to think how he could have sinned, as God was so angry, but he did not discover it. Then he neither ate nor drank, threw himself down on the ground, and prayed day and night. And as he was one day thus bitterly weeping in the forest, he heard a little bird singing beautifully and delightfully, and then he was still more troubled and said, \"How joyously thou singest, the Lord is not angry with thee. Ah, if thou couldst but tell me how I can have offended him, that I might do penance, and then my heart also would be glad again.\" Then the bird began to speak and said, \"Thou hast done injustice, in that thou hast condemned a poor sinner who was being led to the gallows, and for that the Lord is angry with thee. He alone sits in judgement. However, if thou wilt do penance and repent thy sins, he will forgive thee.\" Then the angel stood beside him with a dry branch in his hand and said, \"Thou shalt carry this dry branch until three green twigs sprout out of it, but at night when thou wilt sleep, thou shalt lay it under thy head. Thou shalt beg thy bread from door to door, and not tarry more than one night in the same house. That is the penance which the Lord lays on thee.\"\nThen the hermit took the piece of wood, and went back into the world, which he had not seen for so long. He ate and drank nothing but what was given him at the doors; many petitions were, however, not listened to, and many doors remained shut to him, so that he often did not get a crumb of bread.\n\nOnce when he had gone from door to door from morning till night, and no one had given him anything, and no one would shelter him for the night, he went forth into a forest, and at last found a cave which someone had made, and an old woman was sitting in it. Then said he, \"Good woman, keep me with you in your house for this night;\" but she said, \"No, I dare not, even if I wished, I have three sons who are wicked and wild, if they come home from their robbing expedition, and find you, they would kill us both.\" The hermit said, \"Let me stay, they will do no injury either to you or to me.\" and the woman was compassionate, and let herself be persuaded. Then the man lay down beneath the stairs, and put the bit of wood under his head. When the old woman saw him do that, she asked the reason of it, on which he told her that he carried the bit of wood about with him for a penance, and used it at night for a pillow, and that he had offended the Lord, because, when he had seen a poor sinner on the way to the gallows, he had said he was getting his deserts. Then the woman began to weep and cried, \"If the Lord thus punishes one single word, how will it fare with my sons when they appear before him in judgment?\"\n\nAt midnight the robbers came home and blustered and stormed. They made a fire, and when it had lighted up the cave and they saw a man lying under the stairs, they fell in a rage and cried to their mother, \"Who is the man? Have we not forbidden any one whatsoever to be taken in?\" Then said the mother, \"Let him alone, it is a poor sinner who is expiating his crime.\" The robbers asked, \"What has he done?\" - \"Old man,\" cried they, \"tell us thy sins.\" The old man raised himself and told them how he, by one single word, had so sinned that God was angry with him, and how he was now expiating this crime. The robbers were so powerfully touched in their hearts by this story, that they were shocked with their life up to this time, reflected, and began with hearty repentance to do penance for it. The hermit, after he had converted the three sinners, lay down to sleep again under the stairs. In the morning, however, they found him dead, and out of the dry wood on which his head lay, three green twigs had grown up on high. Thus the Lord had once more received him into his favour.\n</string>
    <string name="story446text">An aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he was stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father, \"Hark thee, my son, I can get nothing into thy head, let me try as I will. Thou must go from hence, I will give thee into the care of a celebrated master, who shall see what he can do with thee.\" The youth was sent into a strange town, and remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this time, he came home again, and his father asked, \"Now, my son, what hast thou learnt?\" - \"Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.\" - \"Lord have mercy on us!\" cried the father; \"is that all thou hast learnt? I will send thee into another town, to another master.\" The youth was taken thither, and stayed a year with this master likewise. When he came back the father again asked, \"My son, what hast thou learnt?\" He answered, \"Father, I have learnt what the birds say.\" Then the father fell into a rage and said, \"Oh, thou lost man, thou hast spent the precious time and learnt nothing; art thou not ashamed to appear before mine eyes? I will send thee to a third master, but if thou learnest nothing this time also, I will no longer be thy father.\" The youth remained a whole year with the third master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired, \"My son, what hast thou learnt?\" he answered, \"Dear father, I have this year learnt what the frogs croak.\" Then the father fell into the most furious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said, \"This man is no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him out into the forest, and kill him.\" They took him forth, but when they should have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go, and they cut the eyes and the tongue out of a deer that they might carry them to the old man as a token.\nThe youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he begged for a night\'s lodging. \"Yes,\" said the lord of the castle, \"if thou wilt pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I warn thee, it is at the peril of thy life, for it is full of wild dogs, which bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to be given to them, whom they at once devour.\" The whole district was in sorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to stop this. The youth, however, was without fear, and said, \"Just let me go down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to them; they will do nothing to harm me.\" As he himself would have it so, they gave him some food for the wild animals, and led him down to the tower. When he went inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged their tails quite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and did not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of everyone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of the castle, \"The dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why they dwell there, and bring evil on the land. They are bewitched, and are obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower, and they can have no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise learnt, from their discourse, how that is to be done.\" Then all who heard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him as a son if he accomplished it successfully. He went down again, and as he knew what he had to do, he did it thoroughly, and brought a chest full of gold out with him. The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth heard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the trouble.\n\nAfter some time he took it into his head that he would travel to Rome. On the way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting croaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they were saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived in Rome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great difficulty as to whom they should appoint as his successor. They at length agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be distinguished by some divine and miraculous token. And just as that was decided on, the young count entered into the church, and suddenly two snow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there. The ecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above, and asked him on the spot if he would be pope. He was undecided, and knew not if he were worthy of this, but the doves counselled him to do it, and at length he said yes. Then was he anointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled what he had heard from the frogs on his way, which had so affected him, that he was to be his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and did not know one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his shoulders, and said it all in his ear.</string>
    <string name="story447text">About a thousand or more years ago, there were in this country nothing but small kings, and one of them who lived on the Keuterberg was very fond of hunting. Once on a time when he was riding forth from his castle with his huntsmen, three girls were watching their cows upon the mountain, and when they saw the King with all his followers, the eldest girl pointed to him, and called to the two other girls, \"If I do not get that one, I will have none.\" Then the second girl answered from the other side of the hill, and pointed to the one who was on the King\'s right hand, \"Hilloa! hilloa! If I do not get him, I will have no one.\" These, however, were the two ministers. The King heard all this, and when he had come back from the chase, he caused the three girls to be brought to him, and asked them what they had said yesterday on the mountain. This they would not tell him, so the King asked the eldest if she really would take him for her husband? Then she said, \"Yes,\" and the two ministers married the two sisters, for they were all three fair and beautiful of face, especially the Queen, who had hair like flax. But the two sisters had no children, and once when the King was obliged to go from home he invited them to come to the Queen in order to cheer her, for she was about to bear a child. She had a little boy who brought a bright red star into the world with him. Then the two sisters said to each other that they would throw the beautiful boy into the water. When they had thrown him in (I believe it was into the Weser) a little bird flew up into the air, which sang ,\n\"To thy death art thou sped,\nUntil God\'s word be said.\nIn the white lily bloom,\nBrave boy, is thy tomb.\"\nWhen the two heard that, they were frightened to death, and ran away in great haste. When the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a dog. Then the King said, \"What God does, is well done!\" But a fisherman who dwelt near the water fished the little boy out again while he was still alive, and as his wife had no children, they reared him. When a year had gone by, the King again went away, and the Queen had another little boy, whom the false sisters likewise took and threw into the water. Then up flew a little bird again and sang,\n\"To thy death art thou sped,\nUntil God\'s word be said.\nIn the white lily bloom,\nBrave boy, is thy tomb.\"\nAnd when the King came back, they told him that the Queen had once more given birth to a dog, and he again said, \"What God does, is well done.\" The fisherman, however, fished this one also out of the water, and reared him.\nThen the King again journeyed forth, and the Queen had a little girl, whom also the false sisters threw into the water. Then again a little bird flew up on high and sang,\n\n\"To thy death art thou sped\nUntil God\'s word be said.\nIn the white lily bloom,\nBonny girl, is thy tomb.\"\nAnd when the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a cat. Then the King grew angry, and ordered his wife to be cast into prison, and therein was she shut up for many long years.\nIn the meantime the children had grown up. Then eldest once went out with some other boys to fish, but the other boys would not have him with them, and said, \"Go thy way, foundling.\"\n\nHereupon he was much troubled, and asked the old fisherman if that was true? The fisherman told him that once when he was fishing he had drawn him out of the water. So the boy said he would go forth and seek his father. The fisherman, however, entreated him to stay, but he would not let himself be hindered, and at last the fisherman consented. Then the boy went on his way and walked for many days, and at last he came to a great piece of water by the side of which stood an old woman fishing. \"Good day, mother,\" said the boy.\n\n\"Many thanks,\" said she.\n\n\"Thou wilt fish long enough before thou catchest anything.\"\n\n\"And thou wilt seek long enough before thou findest thy father. How wilt thou get over the water?\" said the woman.\n\n\"God knows.\"\n\nThen the old woman took him up on her back and carried him through it, and he sought for a long time, but could not find his father.\n\nWhen a year had gone by, the second boy set out to seek his brother. He came to the water, and all fared with him just as with his brother. And now there was no one at home but the daughter, and she mourned for her brothers so much that at last she also begged the fisherman to let her set forth, for she wished to go in search of her brothers. Then she likewise came to the great piece of water, and she said to the old woman, \"Good day, mother.\"\n\n\"Many thanks,\" replied the old woman.\n\n\"May God help you with your fishing,\" said the maiden. When the old woman heard that, she became quite friendly, and carried her over the water, gave her a wand, and said to her, \"Go, my daughter, ever onwards by this road, and when you come to a great black dog, you must pass it silently and boldly, without either laughing or looking at it. Then you will come to a great high castle, on the threshold of which you must let the wand fall, and go straight through the castle, and out again on the other side. There you will see an old fountain out of which a large tree has grown, whereon hangs a bird in a cage which you must take down. Take likewise a glass of water out of the fountain, and with these two things go back by the same way. Pick up the wand again from the threshold and take it with you, and when you again pass by the dog, strike him in the face with it, but be sure that you hit him, and then just come back here to me.\" The maiden found everything exactly as the old woman had said, and on her way back she found her two brothers who had sought each other over half the world. They went together to the place where the black dog was lying on the road; she struck it in the face, and it turned into a handsome prince who went with them to the river. There the old woman was still standing. She rejoiced much to see them again, and carried them all over the water, and then she too went away, for now she was freed. The others, however, went to the old fisherman, and all were glad that they had found each other again, but they hung the bird on the wall.\n\nBut the second son could not settle at home, and took his cross-bow and went a-hunting. When he was tired he took his flute, and made music. The King was hunting too, and heard that and went thither, and when he met the youth, he said, \"Who has given thee leave to hunt here?\"\n\n\"Oh, no one.\"\n\n\"To whom dost thou belong, then?\"\n\n\"I am the fisherman\'s son.\"\n\n\"But he has no children.\"\n\n\"If thou wilt not believe, come with me.\"\n\nThat the King did, and questioned the fisherman, who told everything to him, and the little bird on the wall began to sing,\n\n\"The mother sits alone\nThere in the prison small,\nO King of royal blood,\nThese are thy children all.\nThe sisters twain so false,\nThey wrought the children woe,\nThere in the waters deep\nWhere the fishermen come and go.\"\nThen they were all terrified, and the King took the bird, the fisherman and the three children back with him to the castle, and ordered the prison to be opened and brought his wife out again. She had, however, grown quite ill and weak. Then the daughter gave her some of the water of the fountain to drink, and she became strong and healthy. But the two false sisters were burnt, and the daughter married the prince.</string>
    <string name="story448text">There was once a man, whose wife was dead, and a woman, whose husband was dead; and the man had a daughter, and so had the woman. The girls were acquainted with each other, and used to play together sometimes in the woman\'s house. So the woman said to the man\'s daughter, \"Listen to me, tell your father that I will marry him, and then you shall have milk to wash in every morning and wine to drink, and my daughter shall have water to wash in and water to drink.\" The girl went home and told her father what the woman had said.\n\nThe man said, \"What shall I do! Marriage is a joy, and also a torment.\" At last, as he could come to no conclusion, he took off his boot, and said to his daughter, \"Take this boot, it has a hole in the sole; go up with it into the loft, hang it on the big nail and pour water in it. If it holds water, I will once more take to me a wife; if it lets out the water, so will I not.\"\n\nThe girl did as she was told, but the water held the hole together, and the boot was full up to the top. So she went and told her father how it was. And he went up to see with his own eyes, and as there was no mistake about it, he went to the widow and courted her, and then they had the wedding.\n\nThe next morning, when the two girls awoke, there stood by the bedside of the man\'s daughter milk to wash in and wine to drink, and by the bedside of the woman\'s daughter there stood water to wash in and water to drink. On the second morning there stood water to wash in and water to drink for both of them alike. On the third morning there stood water to wash in and water to drink for the man\'s daughter, and milk to wash in and wine to drink for the woman\'s daughter; and so it remained ever after. The woman hated her stepdaughter, and never knew how to treat her badly enough from one day to another. And she was jealous because her stepdaughter was pleasant and pretty, and her real daughter was ugly and hateful.\n\nOnce in winter, when it was freezing hard, and snow lay deep on hill and valley, the woman made a frock out of paper, called her stepdaughter, and said, \"Here, put on this frock, go out into the wood and fetch me a basket of strawberries; I have a great wish for some.\"\n\n\"Oh dear,\" said the girl, \"there are no strawberries to be found in winter; the ground is frozen, and the snow covers everything. And why should I go in the paper frock? it is so cold out of doors that one\'s breath is frozen; the wind will blow through it, and the thorns will tear it off my back!\"\n\n\"How dare you contradict me!\" cried the stepmother, \"be off, and don\'t let me see you again till you bring me a basket of strawberries.\" Then she gave her a little piece of hard bread, and said, \"That will do for you to eat during the day,\" and she thought to herself, \"She is sure to be frozen or starved to death out of doors, and I shall never set eyes on her again.\"\n\nSo the girl went obediently, put on the paper frock, and started out with the basket. The snow was lying everywhere, far and wide, and there was not a blade of green to be seen. When she entered the wood she saw a little house with three little men peeping out of it. She wished them good day, and knocked modestly at the door. They called her in, and she came into the room and sat down by the side of the oven to warm herself and eat her breakfast. The little men said, \"Give us some of it.\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" answered she, breaking her little piece of bread in two, and giving them half. They then said, \"What are you doing here in the wood this winter time in your little thin frock?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" answered she, \"I have to get a basket of strawberries, and I must not go home without them.\" When she had eaten her bread they gave her a broom, and told her to go and sweep the snow away from the back door. When she had gone outside to do it the little men talked among themselves about what they should do for her, as she was so good and pretty, and had shared her bread with them. Then the first one said, \"She shall grow prettier every day.\" The second said, \"Each time she speaks a piece of gold shall fall from her mouth.\" The third said, \"A king shall come and take her for his wife.\"\n\nIn the meanwhile the girl was doing as the little men had told her, and had cleared the snow from the back of the little house, and what do you suppose she found? fine ripe strawberries, showing dark red against the snow! Then she joyfully filled her little basket full, thanked the little men, shook hands with them all, and ran home in haste to bring her stepmother the thing she longed for. As she went in and said, \"Good evening,\" a piece of gold fell from her mouth at once. Then she related all that had happened to her in the wood, and at each word that she spoke gold pieces fell out of her mouth, so that soon they were scattered all over the room.\n\n\"Just look at her pride and conceit!\" cried the stepsister, \"throwing money about in this way!\" but in her heart she was jealous because of it, and wanted to go too into the wood to fetch strawberries. But the mother said, \"No, my dear little daughter, it is too cold, you will be frozen to death.\" But she left her no peace, so at last the mother gave in, got her a splendid fur coat to put on, and gave her bread and butter and cakes to eat on the way.\n\nThe girl went into the wood and walked straight up to the little house. The three little men peeped out again, but she gave them no greeting, and without looking round or taking any notice of them she came stumping into the room, sat herself down by the oven, and began to eat her bread and butter and cakes.\n\n\"Give us some of that,\" cried the little men, but she answered, \"I\'ve not enough for myself; how can I give away any?\" Now when she had done with her eating, they said, \"Here is a broom, go and sweep all clean by the back door.\"\n\n\"Oh, go and do it yourselves,\" answered she; \"I am not your housemaid.\" But when she saw that they were not going to give her anything, she went out to the door. Then the three little men said among themselves, \"What shall we do to her, because she is so unpleasant, and has such a wicked jealous heart, grudging everybody everything?\" The first said, \"She shall grow uglier every day.\" The second said, \"Each time she speaks a toad shall jump out of her mouth at every word.\" The third said, \"She shall die a miserable death.\"\n\nThe girl was looking outside for strawberries, but as she found none, she went sulkily home. And directly she opened her mouth to tell her mother what had happened to her in the wood a toad sprang out of her mouth at each word, so that every one who came near her was quite disgusted.\n\nThe stepmother became more and more set against the man\'s daughter, whose beauty increased day by day, and her only thought was how to do her some injury. So at last she took a kettle, set it on the fire, and scalded some yarn in it. When it was ready she hung it over the poor girl\'s shoulder, and gave her an axe, and she was to go to the frozen river and break a hole in the ice, and there to rinse the yarn. She obeyed, and went and hewed a hole in the ice, and as she was about it there came by a splendid coach, in which the King sat. The coach stood still, and the King said, \"My child, who art thou, and what art thou doing there?\"\n\nShe answered, \"I am a poor girl, and am rinsing yarn.\" Then the King felt pity for her, and as he saw that she was very beautiful, he said, \"Will you go with me?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, with all my heart,\" answered she; and she felt very glad to be out of the way of her mother and sister.\n\nSo she stepped into the coach and went off with the King; and when they reached his castle the wedding was celebrated with great splendour, as the little men in the wood had foretold.\nAt the end of a year the young Queen had a son; and as the stepmother had heard of her great good fortune she came with her daughter to the castle, as if merely to pay the King and Queen a visit. One day, when the King had gone out, and when nobody was about, the bad woman took the Queen by the head, and her daughter took her by the heels, and dragged her out of bed, and threw her out of the window into a stream that flowed beneath it. Then the old woman put her ugly daughter in the bed, and covered her up to her chin.\n\nWhen the King came back, and wanted to talk to his wife a little, the old woman cried, \"Stop, stop! she is sleeping nicely; she must be kept quiet to day.\" The King dreamt of nothing wrong, and came again the next morning; and as he spoke to his wife, and she answered him, there jumped each time out of her mouth a toad instead of the piece of gold as heretofore. Then he asked why that should be, and the old woman said it was because of her great weakness, and that it would pass away.\n\nBut in the night, the boy who slept in the kitchen saw how something in the likeness of a duck swam up the gutter, and said,\n\n\"My King, what mak\'st thou?\nSleepest thou, or wak\'st thou?\"\n\nBut there was no answer. Then it said,\n\n\"What cheer my two guests keep they?\"\n\nSo the kitchen-boy answered,\n\n\"In bed all soundly sleep they.\"\n\nIt asked again,\n\n\"And my little baby, how does he?\"\n\nAnd he answered,\n\n\"He sleeps in his cradle quietly.\"\n\nThen the duck took the shape of the Queen and went to the child, and gave him to drink, smoothed his little bed, covered him up again, and then, in the likeness of a duck, swam back down the gutter. In this way she came two nights, and on the third she said to the kitchen-boy, \"Go and tell the King to brandish his sword three times over me on the threshold!\" Then the kitchen-boy ran and told the King, and he came with his sword and brandished it three times over the duck, and at the third time his wife stood before him living, and hearty, and sound, as she had been before.\n\nThe King was greatly rejoiced, but he hid the Queen in a chamber until the Sunday came when the child was to be baptized. And after the baptism he said, \"What does that person deserve who drags another out of; bed and throws him in the water?\"\n\nAnd the old woman answered, \"No better than to be put into a cask with iron nails in it, and to be rolled in it down the hill into the water.\" Then said the King, \"You have spoken your own sentence;\"and he ordered a cask to be fetched, and the old woman and her daughter were put into it, and the top hammered down, and the cask was rolled down the hill into the river.</string>
    <string name="story449text">A certain King had three sons who were all equally dear to him, and he did not know which of them to appoint as his successor after his own death. When the time came when he was about to die, he summoned them to his bedside and said, \"Dear children, I have been thinking of something which I will declare unto you; whichsoever of you is the laziest shall have the kingdom.\" The eldest said, \"Then, father, the kingdom is mine, for I am so idle that if I lie down to rest, and a drop falls in my eye, I will not open it that I may sleep.\" The second said; \"Father, the kingdom belongs to me, for I am so idle that when I am sitting by the fire warming myself, I would rather let my heel be burnt off than draw back my leg.\" The third said, \"Father, the kingdom is mine, for I am so idle that if I were going to be hanged, and had the rope already round my neck, and any one put a sharp knife into my hand with which I might cut the rope, I would rather let myself be hanged than raise my hand to the rope.\" When the father heard that, he said, \"Thou hast carried it the farthest, and shalt be King.\"</string>
    <string name="story450text">There was once on a time a poor man, who could no longer support his only son. Then said the son, \"Dear father, things go so badly with us that I am a burden to you. I would rather go away and see how I can earn my bread.\" So the father gave him his blessing, and with great sorrow took leave of him. At this time the King of a mighty empire was at war, and the youth took service with him, and with him went out to fight. And when he came before the enemy, there was a battle, and great danger, and it rained shot until his comrades fell on all sides, and when the leader also was killed, those left were about to take flight, but the youth stepped forth, spoke boldly to them, and cried, \"We will not let our fatherland be ruined!\" Then the others followed him, and he pressed on and conquered the enemy. When the King heard that he owed the victory to him alone, he raised him above all the others, gave him great treasures, and made him the first in the kingdom.\nThe King had a daughter who was very beautiful, but she was also very strange. She had made a vow to take no one as her lord and husband who did not promise to let himself be buried alive with her if she died first. \"If he loves me with all his heart,\" said she, \"of what use will life be to him afterwards?\" On her side she would do the same, and if he died first, would go down to the grave with him. This strange oath had up to this time frightened away all wooers, but the youth became so charmed with her beauty that he cared for nothing, but asked her father for her. \"But dost thou know what thou must promise?\" said the King. \"I must be buried with her,\" he replied, \"if I outlive her, but my love is so great that I do not mind the danger.\" Then the King consented, and the wedding was solemnized with great splendour.\n\nThey lived now for a while happy and contented with each other, and then it befell that the young Queen was attacked by a severe illness, and no physician could save her. And as she lay there dead, the young King remembered what he had been obliged to promise, and was horrified at having to lie down alive in the grave, but there was no escape. The King had placed sentries at all the gates, and it was not possible to avoid his fate. When the day came when the corpse was to be buried, he was taken down into the royal vault with it and then the door was shut and bolted.\n\nNear the coffin stood a table on which were four candles, four loaves of bread, and four bottles of wine, and when this provision came to an end, he would have to die of hunger. And now he sat there full of pain and grief, ate every day only a little piece of bread, drank only a mouthful of wine, and nevertheless saw death daily drawing nearer. Whilst he thus gazed before him, he saw a snake creep out of a corner of the vault and approach the dead body. And as he thought it came to gnaw at it, he drew his sword and said, \"As long as I live, thou shalt not touch her,\" and hewed the snake in three pieces. After a time a second snake crept out of the hole, and when it saw the other lying dead and cut in pieces, it went back, but soon came again with three green leaves in its mouth. Then it took the three pieces of the snake, laid them together, as they ought to go, and placed one of the leaves on each wound. Immediately the severed parts joined themselves together, the snake moved, and became alive again, and both of them hastened away together. The leaves were left lying on the ground, and a desire came into the mind of the unhappy man who had been watching all this, to know if the wondrous power of the leaves which had brought the snake to life again, could not likewise be of service to a human being. So he picked up the leaves and laid one of them on the mouth of his dead wife, and the two others on her eyes. And hardly had he done this than the blood stirred in her veins, rose into her pale face, and coloured it again. Then she drew breath, opened her eyes, and said, \"Ah, God, where am I?\" - \"Thou art with me, dear wife,\" he answered, and told her how everything had happened, and how he had brought her back again to life. Then he gave her some wine and bread, and when she had regained her strength, he raised her up and they went to the door and knocked, and called so loudly that the sentries heard it, and told the King. The King came down himself and opened the door, and there he found both strong and well, and rejoiced with them that now all sorrow was over. The young King, however, took the three snake-leaves with him, gave them to a servant and said, \"Keep them for me carefully, and carry them constantly about thee; who knows in what trouble they may yet be of service to us!\"\n\nA change had, however, taken place in his wife; after she had been restored to life, it seemed as if all love for her husband had gone out of her heart. After some time, when he wanted to make a voyage over the sea, to visit his old father, and they had gone on board a ship, she forgot the great love and fidelity which he had shown her, and which had been the means of rescuing her from death, and conceived a wicked inclination for the skipper. And once when the young King lay there asleep, she called in the skipper and seized the sleeper by the head, and the skipper took him by the feet, and thus they threw him down into the sea. When the shameful deed was done, she said, \"Now let us return home, and say that he died on the way. I will extol and praise thee so to my father that he will marry me to thee, and make thee the heir to his crown.\" But the faithful servant who had seen all that they did, unseen by them, unfastened a little boat from the ship, got into it, sailed after his master, and let the traitors go on their way. He fished up the dead body, and by the help of the three snake-leaves which he carried about with him, and laid on the eyes and mouth, he fortunately brought the young King back to life.\n\nThey both rowed with all their strength day and night, and their little boat flew so swiftly that they reached the old King before the others did. He was astonished when he saw them come alone, and asked what had happened to them. When he learnt the wickedness of his daughter he said, \"I cannot believe that she has behaved so ill, but the truth will soon come to light,\" and bade both go into a secret chamber and keep themselves hidden from every one. Soon afterwards the great ship came sailing in, and the godless woman appeared before her father with a troubled countenance. He said, \"Why dost thou come back alone? Where is thy husband?\" - \"Ah, dear father,\" she replied, \"I come home again in great grief; during the voyage, my husband became suddenly ill and died, and if the good skipper had not given me his help, it would have gone ill with me. He was present at his death, and can tell you all.\" The King said, \"I will make the dead alive again,\" and opened the chamber, and bade the two come out. When the woman saw her husband, she was thunderstruck, and fell on her knees and begged for mercy. The King said, \"There is no mercy. He was ready to die with thee and restored thee to life again, but thou hast murdered him in his sleep, and shalt receive the reward that thou deservest.\" Then she was placed with her accomplice in a ship which had been pierced with holes, and sent out to sea, where they soon sank amid the waves.</string>
    <string name="story451text">There was once a girl who was lazy and would not spin, and her mother could not persuade her to it, do what she would. At last the mother became angry and out of patience, and gave her a good beating, so that she cried out loudly. At that moment the Queen was going by; as she heard the crying, she stopped; and, going into the house, she asked the mother why she was beating her daughter, so that every one outside in the street could hear her cries. The woman was ashamed to tell of her daughter\'s laziness, so she said, \"I cannot stop her from spinning; she is for ever at it, and I am poor and cannot furnish her with flax enough.\" Then the Queen answered, \"I like nothing better than the sound of the spinning-wheel, and always feel happy when I hear its humming; let me take your daughter with me to the castle - I have plenty of flax, she shall spin there to her heart\'s content.\" The mother was only too glad of the offer, and the Queen took the girl with her.\n\nWhen they reached the castle the Queen showed her three rooms which were filled with the finest flax as full as they could hold.\n\n\"Now you can spin me this flax,\" said she, \"and when you can show it me all done you shall have my eldest son for bridegroom; you may be poor, but I make nothing of that - your industry is dowry enough.\" The girl was inwardly terrified, for she could not have spun the flax, even if she were to live to be a hundred years old, and were to sit spinning every day of her life from morning to evening. And when she found herself alone she began to weep, and sat so for three days without putting her hand to it. On the third day the Queen came, and when she saw that nothing had been done of the spinning she was much surprised; but the girl excused herself by saying that she had not been able to begin because of the distress she was in at leaving her home and her mother. The excuse contented the Queen, who said, however, as she went away, \"Tomorrow you must begin to work.\"\n\nWhen the girl found herself alone again she could not tell how to help herself or what to do, and in her perplexity she went and gazed out of the window. There she saw three women passing by, and the first of them had a broad flat foot, the second had a big under-lip that hung down over her chin, and the third had a remarkably broad thumb. They all of them stopped in front of the window, and called out to know what it was that the girl wanted. She told them all her need, and they promised her their help, and said, \"Then will you invite us to your wedding, and not be ashamed of us, and call us your cousins, and let us sit at your table; if you will promise this, we will finish off your flax-spinning in a very short time.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" answered the girl; \"only come in now, and begin at once.\"\n\nThen these same women came in, and she cleared a space in the first room for them to sit and carry on their spinning. The first one drew out the thread and moved the treddle that turned the wheel, the second moistened the thread, the third twisted it, and rapped with her finger on the table, and as often as she rapped a heap of yarn fell to the ground, and it was most beautifully spun. But the girl hid the three spinsters out of the Queen\'s sight, and only showed her, as often as she came, the heaps of well-spun yarn; and there was no end to the praises she received. When the first room was empty they went on to the second, and then to the third, so that at last all was finished. Then the three women took their leave, saying to the girl, \"Do not forget what you have promised, and it will be all the better for you.\"\n\nSo when the girl took the Queen and showed her the empty rooms, and the great heaps of yarn, the wedding was at once arranged, and the bridegroom rejoiced that he should have so clever and diligent a wife, and praised her exceedingly.\n\n\"I have three cousins,\" said the girl, \"and as they have shown me a great deal of kindness, I would not wish to forget them in my good fortune; may I be allowed to invite them to the wedding, and to ask them to sit at the table with us?\" The Queen and the bridegroom said at once, \"There is no reason against it.\"\n\nSo when the feast began in came the three spinsters in strange guise, and the bride said, \"Dear cousins, you are welcome.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the bridegroom, \"how come you to have such dreadfully ugly relations?\" And then he went up to the first spinster and said, \"How is it that you have such a broad flat foot?\"\n\n\"With treading,\" answered she, \"with treading.\" Then he went up to the second and said, \"How is it that you have such a great hanging lip?\"\n\n\"With licking,\" answered she, \"with licking.\"\n\nThen he asked the third, \"How is it that you have such a broad thumb?\"\n\n\"With twisting thread,\" answered she, \"with twisting thread.\" Then the bridegroom said that from that time forward his beautiful bride should never touch a spinning-wheel. And so she escaped that tiresome flax-spinning.</string>
    <string name="story452text">A certain tailor had a son, who happened to be small, and no bigger than a Thumb, and on this account he was always called Thumbling. He had, however, some courage in him, and said to his father, \"Father, I must and will go out into the world.\" - \"That\'s right, my son,\" said the old man, and took a long darning-needle and made a knob of sealing-wax on it at the candle, \"and there is a sword for thee to take with thee on the way.\" Then the little tailor wanted to have one more meal with them, and hopped into the kitchen to see what his lady mother had cooked for the last time. It was, however, just dished up, and the dish stood on the hearth. Then he said, \"Mother, what is there to eat to-day?\" - \"See for thyself,\" said his mother. So Thumbling jumped on to the hearth, and peeped into the dish, but as he stretched his neck in too far the steam from the food caught hold of him, and carried him up the chimney. He rode about in the air on the steam for a while, until at length he sank down to the ground again. Now the little tailor was outside in the wide world, and he travelled about, and went to a master in his craft, but the food was not good enough for him. \"Mistress, if you give us no better food,\" said Thumbling, \"I will go away, and early to-morrow morning I will write with chalk on the door of your house, \'Too many potatoes, too little meat! Farewell, Mr. Potato-King.\'\" - \"What wouldst thou have forsooth, grasshopper?\" said the mistress, and grew angry, and seized a dishcloth, and was just going to strike him; but my little tailor crept nimbly under a thimble, peeped out from beneath it, and put his tongue out at the mistress. She took up the thimble, and wanted to get hold of him, but little Thumbling hopped into the cloth, and while the mistress was opening it out and looking for him, he got into a crevice in the table. \"Ho, ho, lady mistress,\" cried he, and thrust his head out, and when she began to strike him he leapt down into the drawer. At last, however, she caught him and drove him out of the house.\nThe little tailor journeyed on and came to a great forest, and there he fell in with a band of robbers who had a design to steal the King\'s treasure. When they saw the little tailor, they thought, \"A little fellow like that can creep through a key-hole and serve as picklock to us.\" - \"Hollo,\" cried one of them, \"thou giant Goliath, wilt thou go to the treasure-chamber with us? Thou canst slip thyself in and throw out the money.\" Thumbling reflected a while, and at length he said, \"yes,\" and went with them to the treasure-chamber. Then he looked at the doors above and below, to see if there was any crack in them. It was not long before he espied one which was broad enough to let him in. He was therefore about to get in at once, but one of the two sentries who stood before the door, observed him, and said to the other, \"What an ugly spider is creeping there; I will kill it.\" - \"Let the poor creature alone,\" said the other; \"it has done thee no harm.\" Then Thumbling got safely through the crevice into the treasure-chamber, opened the window beneath which the robbers were standing, and threw out to them one thaler after another. When the little tailor was in the full swing of his work, he heard the King coming to inspect his treasure-chamber, and crept hastily into a hiding-place. The King noticed that several solid thalers were missing, but could not conceive who could have stolen them, for locks and bolts were in good condition, and all seemed well guarded. Then he went away again, and said to the sentries, \"Be on the watch, some one is after the money.\" When therefore Thumbling recommenced his labours, they heard the money moving, and a sound of klink, klink, klink. They ran swiftly in to seize the thief, but the little tailor, who heard them coming, was still swifter, and leapt into a corner and covered himself with a thaler, so that nothing could be seen of him, and at the same time he mocked the sentries and cried, \"Here am I!\" The sentries ran thither, but as they got there, he had already hopped into another corner under a thaler, and was crying, \"Ho, ho, here am I!\" The watchmen sprang there in haste, but Thumbling had long ago got into a third corner, and was crying, \"Ho, ho, here am I!\" And thus he made fools of them, and drove them so long round about the treasure-chamber that they were weary and went away. Then by degrees he threw all the thalers out, dispatching the last with all his might, then hopped nimbly upon it, and flew down with it through the window. The robbers paid him great compliments. \"Thou art a valiant hero,\" said they; \"wilt thou be our captain?\"\n\nThumbling, however, declined, and said he wanted to see the world first. They now divided the booty, but the little tailor only asked for a kreuzer because he could not carry more.\n\nThen he once more buckled on his sword, bade the robbers goodbye, and took to the road. First, he went to work with some masters, but he had no liking for that, and at last he hired himself as man-servant in an inn. The maids, however, could not endure him, for he saw all they did secretly, without their seeing him, and he told their master and mistress what they had taken off the plates, and carried away out of the cellar, for themselves. Then said they, \"Wait, and we will pay thee off!\" and arranged with each other to play him a trick. Soon afterwards when one of the maids was mowing in the garden, and saw Thumbling jumping about and creeping up and down the plants, she mowed him up quickly with the grass, tied all in a great cloth, and secretly threw it to the cows. Now amongst them there was a great black one, who swallowed him down without hurting him. Down below, however, it pleased him ill, for it was quite dark, neither was any candle burning. When the cow was being milked he cried,\n\n\"Strip, strap, strull,\nWill the pail soon be full?\"\nBut the noise of the milking prevented his being understood. After this the master of the house came into the cow-byre and said, \"That cow shall be killed to-morrow.\" Then Thumbling was so alarmed that he cried out in a clear voice, \"Let me out first, for I am shut up inside her.\" The master heard that quite well, but did not know from whence the voice came. \"Where art thou?\" asked he. \"In the black one,\" answered Thumbling, but the master did not understand what that meant, and went out.\nNext morning the cow was killed. Happily Thumbling did not meet with one blow at the cutting up and chopping; he got among the sausage-meat. And when the butcher came in and began his work, he cried out with all his might, \"Don\'t chop too deep, don\'t chop too deep, I am amongst it.\" No one heard this because of the noise of the chopping-knife. Now poor Thumbling was in trouble, but trouble sharpens the wits, and he sprang out so adroitly between the blows that none of them touched him, and he escaped with a whole skin. But still he could not get away, there was nothing for it but to let himself be thrust into a black-pudding with the bits of bacon. His quarters there were rather confined, and besides that he was hung up in the chimney to be smoked, and there time did hang terribly heavy on his hands.\n\nAt length in winter he was taken down again, as the black-pudding had to be set before a guest. When the hostess was cutting it in slices, he took care not to stretch out his head too far lest a bit of it should be cut off; at last he saw his opportunity, cleared a passage for himself, and jumped out.\n\nThe little tailor, however, would not stay any longer in a house where he fared so ill, so at once set out on his journey again. But his liberty did not last long. In the open country he met with a fox who snapped him up in a fit of absence. \"Hollo, Mr. Fox,\" cried the little tailor, \"it is I who am sticking in your throat, set me at liberty again.\" - \"Thou art right,\" answered the fox. \"Thou art next to nothing for me, but if thou wilt promise me the fowls in thy father\'s yard I will let thee go.\" - \"With all my heart,\" replied Thumbling. \"Thou shalt have all the cocks and hens, that I promise thee.\" Then the fox let him go again, and himself carried him home. When the father once more saw his dear son, he willingly gave the fox all the fowls which he had. \"For this I likewise bring thee a handsome bit of money,\" said Thumbling, and gave his father the kreuzer which he earned on his travels.\n\n\"But why did the fox get the poor chickens to eat?\" - \"Oh, you goose, your father would surely love his child far more than the fowls in the yard!\"</string>
    <string name="story453text">There was once a poor countryman who used to sit in the chimney-corner all evening and poke the fire, while his wife sat at her spinning-wheel. And he used to say, \"How dull it is without any children about us; our house is so quiet, and other people\'s houses so noisy and merry!\" - \"Yes,\" answered his wife, and sighed, \"if we could only have one, and that one ever so little, no bigger than my thumb, how happy I should be! It would, indeed, be having our heart\'s desire.\" Now, it happened that after a while the woman had a child who was perfect in all his limbs, but no bigger than a thumb. Then the parents said, \"He is just what we wished for, and we will love him very much,\" and they named him according to his stature, \"Tom Thumb.\" And though they gave him plenty of nourishment, he grew no bigger, but remained exactly the same size as when he was first born; and he had very good faculties, and was very quick and prudent, so that all he did prospered.\n\nOne day his father made ready to go into the forest to cut wood, and he said, as if to himself, \"Now, I wish there was some one to bring the cart to meet me.\" - \"O father,\" cried Tom Thumb, \"I can bring the cart, let me alone for that, and in proper time, too!\" Then the father laughed, and said, \"How will you manage that? You are much too little to hold the reins.\" - \"That has nothing to do with it, father; while my mother goes on with her spinning I will sit in the horse\'s ear and tell him where to go.\" - \"Well,\" answered the father, \"we will try it for once.\" When it was time to set off, the mother went on spinning, after setting Tom Thumb in the horse\'s ear; and so he drove off, crying, \"Gee-up, gee-wo!\" So the horse went on quite as if his master were driving him, and drew the waggon along the right road to the wood. Now it happened just as they turned a corner, and the little fellow was calling out \"Gee-up!\" that two strange men passed by. \"Look,\" said one of them, \"how is this? There goes a waggon, and the driver is calling to the horse, and yet he is nowhere to be seen.\" - \"It is very strange,\" said the other; \"we will follow the waggon, and see where it belongs.\" And the wagon went right through the wood, up to the place where the wood had been hewed. When Tom Thumb caught sight of his father, he cried out, \"Look, father, here am I with the wagon; now, take me down.\" The father held the horse with his left hand, and with the right he lifted down his little son out of the horse\'s ear, and Tom Thumb sat down on a stump, quite happy and content. When the two strangers saw him they were struck dumb with wonder. At last one of them, taking the other aside, said to him, \"Look here, the little chap would make our fortune if we were to show him in the town for money. Suppose we buy him.\" So they went up to the woodcutter, and said, \"Sell the little man to us; we will take care he shall come to no harm.\" - \"No,\" answered the father; \"he is the apple of my eye, and not for all the money in the world would I sell him.\" But Tom Thumb, when he heard what was going on, climbed up by his father\'s coat tails, and, perching himself on his shoulder, he whispered in his ear, \"Father, you might as well let me go. I will soon come back again.\" Then the father gave him up to the two men for a large piece of money. They asked him where he would like to sit, \"Oh, put me on the brim of your hat,\" said he. \"There I can walk about and view the country, and be in no danger of falling off.\" So they did as he wished, and when Tom Thumb had taken leave of his father, they set off all together. And they travelled on until it grew dusk, and the little fellow asked to be set down a little while for a change, and after some difficulty they consented. So the man took him down from his hat, and set him in a field by the roadside, and he ran away directly, and, after creeping about among the furrows, he slipped suddenly into a mouse-hole, just what he was looking for. \"Good evening, my masters, you can go home without me!\"cried he to them, laughing. They ran up and felt about with their sticks in the mouse-hole, but in vain. Tom Thumb crept farther and farther in, and as it was growing dark, they had to make the best of their way home, full of vexation, and with empty purses.\n\nWhen Tom Thumb found they were gone, he crept out of his hiding-place underground. \"It is dangerous work groping about these holes in the darkness,\" said he; \"I might easily break my neck.\" But by good fortune he came upon an empty snail shell. \"That\'s all right,\" said he. \"Now I can get safely through the night;\" and he settled himself down in it. Before he had time to get to sleep, he heard two men pass by, and one was saying to the other, \"How can we manage to get hold of the rich parson\'s gold and silver?\" - \"I can tell you how,\" cried Tom Thumb. \"How is this?\" said one of the thieves, quite frightened, \"I hear some one speak!\" So they stood still and listened, and Tom Thumb spoke again. \"Take me with you; I will show you how to do it!\" - \"Where are you, then?\" asked they. \"Look about on the ground and notice where the voice comes from,\" answered he. At last they found him, and lifted him up. \"You little elf,\" said they, \"how can you help us?\" - \"Look here,\" answered he, \"I can easily creep between the iron bars of the parson\'s room and hand out to you whatever you would like to have.\" - \"Very well,\" said they, ff we will try what you can do.\" So when they came to the parsonage-house, Tom Thumb crept into the room, but cried out with all his might, \"Will you have all that is here?\" So the thieves were terrified, and said, \"Do speak more softly, lest any one should be awaked.\" But Tom Thumb made as if he did not hear them, and cried out again, \"What would you like? will you have all that is here?\" so that the cook, who was sleeping in a room hard by, heard it, and raised herself in bed and listened. The thieves, however, in their fear of being discovered, had run back part of the way, but they took courage again, thinking that it was only a jest of the little fellow\'s. So they came back and whispered to him to be serious, and to hand them out something. Then Tom Thumb called out once more as loud as he could, \"Oh yes, I will give it all to you, only put out your hands.\" Then the listening maid heard him distinctly that time, and jumped out of bed, and burst open the door. The thieves ran off as if the wild huntsman were behind them; but the maid, as she could see nothing, went to fetch a light. And when she came back with one, Tom Thumb had taken himself off, without being seen by her, into the barn; and the maid, when she had looked in every hole and corner and found nothing, went back to bed at last, and thought that she must have been dreaming with her eyes and ears open.\n\nSo Tom Thumb crept among the hay, and found a comfortable nook to sleep in, where he intended to remain until it was day, and then to go home to his father and mother. But other things were to befall him; indeed, there is nothing but trouble and worry in this world! The maid got up at dawn of day to feed the cows. The first place she went to was the barn, where she took up an armful of hay, and it happened to be the very heap in which Tom Thumb lay asleep. And he was so fast asleep, that he was aware of nothing, and never waked until he was in the mouth of the cow, who had taken him up with the hay. \"Oh dear,\" cried he, \"how is it that I have got into a mill!\" but he soon found out where he was, and he had to be very careful not to get between the cow\'s teeth, and at last he had to descend into the cow\'s stomach. \"The windows were forgotten when this little room was built,\" said he, \"and the sunshine cannot get in; there is no light to be had.\" His quarters were in every way unpleasant to him, and, what was the worst, new hay was constantly coming in, and the space was being filled up. At last he cried out in his extremity, as loud as he could, \"No more hay for me! no more hay for me!\" The maid was then milking the cow, and as she heard a voice, but could see no one, and as it was the same voice that she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off her stool, and spilt the milk. Then she ran in great haste to her master, crying, \"Oh, master dear, the cow spoke!\" - \"You must be crazy,\" answered her master, and he went himself to the cow-house to see what was the matter. No sooner had he put his foot inside the door, than Tom Thumb cried out again, \"No more hay for me! no more hay for me!\" Then the parson himself was frightened, supposing that a bad spirit had entered into the cow, and he ordered her to be put to death. So she was killed, but the stomach, where Tom Thumb was lying, was thrown upon a dunghill. Tom Thumb had great trouble to work his way out of it, and he had just made a space big enough for his head to go through, when a new misfortune happened. A hungry wolf ran up and swallowed the whole stomach at one gulp. But Tom Thumb did not lose courage. \"Perhaps,\" thought he, \"the wolf will listen to reason,\" and he cried out from the inside of the wolf,\" My dear wolf, I can tell you where to get a splendid meal!\" - \"Where is it to be had?\" asked the wolf. \"In such and such a house, and you must creep into it through the drain, and there you will find cakes and bacon and broth, as much as you can eat,\" and he described to him his father\'s house. The wolf needed not to be told twice. He squeezed himself through the drain in the night, and feasted in the store-room to his heart\'s content. When, at last, he was satisfied, he wanted to go away again, but he had become so big, that to creep the same way back was impossible. This Tom Thumb had reckoned upon, and began to make a terrible din inside the wolf, crying and calling as loud as he could. \"Will you be quiet?\" said the wolf; \"you will wake the folks up!\" - \"Look here,\" cried the little man, \"you are very well satisfied, and now I will do something for my own enjoyment,\" and began again to make all the noise he could. At last the father and mother were awakened, and they ran to the room-door and peeped through the chink, and when they saw a wolf in occupation, they ran and fetched weapons - the man an axe, and the wife a scythe. \"Stay behind,\" said the man, as they entered the room; \"when I have given him a blow, and it does not seem to have killed him, then you must cut at him with your scythe.\" Then Tom Thumb heard his father\'s voice, and cried, \"Dear father; I am here in the wolfs inside.\" Then the father called out full of joy, \"Thank heaven that we have found our dear child!\" and told his wife to keep the scythe out of the way, lest Tom Thumb should be hurt with it. Then he drew near and struck the wolf such a blow on the head that he fell down dead; and then\" he fetched a knife and a pair of scissors, slit up the wolf\'s body, and let out the little fellow. \"Oh, what anxiety we have felt about you!\" said the father. \"Yes, father, I have seen a good deal of the world, and I am very glad to breathe fresh air again.\" - \"And where have you been all this time?\" asked his father. \"Oh, I have been in a mouse-hole and a snail\'s shell, in a cow\'s stomach and a wolfs inside: now, I think, I will stay at home.\" - \"And we will not part with you for all the kingdoms of the world,\" cried the parents, as they kissed and hugged their dear little Tom Thumb. And they gave him something to eat and drink, and a new suit of clothes, as his old ones were soiled with travel.</string>
    <string name="story454text">There was once on a time a girl who was young and beautiful, but she had lost her mother when she was quite a child, and her step-mother did all she could to make the girl\'s life wretched. Whenever this woman gave her anything to do, she worked at it indefatigably, and did everything that lay in her power. Still she could not touch the heart of the wicked woman by that; she was never satisfied; it was never enough. The harder the girl worked, the more work was put upon her, and all that the woman thought of was how to weigh her down with still heavier burdens, and make her life still more miserable.\nOne day she said to her, \"Here are twelve pounds of feathers which thou must pick, and if they are not done this evening, thou mayst expect a good beating. Dost thou imagine thou art to idle away the whole day?\" The poor girl sat down to the work, but tears ran down her cheeks as she did so, for she saw plainly enough that it was quite impossible to finish the work in one day. Whenever she had a little heap of feathers lying before her, and she sighed or smote her hands together in her anguish, they flew away, and she had to pick them out again, and begin her work anew. Then she put her elbows on the table, laid her face in her two hands, and cried, \"Is there no one, then, on God\'s earth to have pity on me?\" Then she heard a low voice which said, \"Be comforted, my child, I have come to help thee.\" The maiden looked up, and an old woman was by her side. She took the girl kindly by the hand, and said, \"Only tell me what is troubling thee.\" As she spoke so kindly, the girl told her of her miserable life, and how one burden after another was laid upon her, and she never could get to the end of the work which was given to her. \"If I have not done these feathers by this evening, my step-mother will beat me; she has threatened she will, and I know she keeps her word.\" Her tears began to flow again, but the good old woman said, \"Do not be afraid, my child; rest a while, and in the meantime I will look to thy work.\" The girl lay down on her bed, and soon fell asleep. The old woman seated herself at the table with the feathers, and how they did fly off the quills, which she scarcely touched with her withered hands! The twelve pounds were soon finished, and when the girl awoke, great snow-white heaps were lying, piled up, and everything in the room was neatly cleared away, but the old woman had vanished. The maiden thanked God, and sat still till evening came, when the step-mother came in and marvelled to see the work completed. \"Just look, you awkward creature,\" said she, \"what can be done when people are industrious; and why couldst thou not set about something else? There thou sittest with thy hands crossed.\" When she went out she said, \"The creature is worth more than her salt. I must give her some work that is still harder.\"\n\nNext morning she called the girl, and said, \"There is a spoon for thee; with that thou must empty out for me the great pond which is beside the garden, and if it is not done by night, thou knowest what will happen.\" The girl took the spoon, and saw that it was full of holes; but even if it had not been, she never could have emptied the pond with it. She set to work at once, knelt down by the water, into which her tears were falling, and began to empty it. But the good old woman appeared again, and when she learnt the cause of her grief, she said, \"Be of good cheer, my child. Go into the thicket and lie down and sleep; I will soon do thy work.\" As soon as the old woman was alone, she barely touched the pond, and a vapour rose up on high from the water, and mingled itself with the clouds. Gradually the pond was emptied, and when the maiden awoke before sunset and came thither, she saw nothing but the fishes which were struggling in the mud. She went to her step-mother, and showed her that the work was done. \"It ought to have been done long before this,\" said she, and grew white with anger, but she meditated something new.\n\nOn the third morning she said to the girl, \"Thou must build me a castle on the plain there, and it must be ready by the evening.\" The maiden was dismayed, and said, \"How can I complete such a great work?\" - \"I will endure no opposition,\" screamed the step-mother. If thou canst empty a pond with a spoon that is full of holes, thou canst build a castle too. I will take possession of it this very day, and if anything is wanting, even if it be the most trifling thing in the kitchen or cellar, thou knowest what lies before thee!\" She drove the girl out, and when she entered the valley, the rocks were there, piled up one above the other, and all her strength would not have enabled her even to move the very smallest of them. She sat down and wept, and still she hoped the old woman would help her. The old woman was not long in coming; she comforted her and said, \"Lie down there in the shade and sleep, and I will soon build the castle for thee. If it would be a pleasure to thee, thou canst live in it thyself.\" When the maiden had gone away, the old woman touched the gray rocks. They began to rise, and immediately moved together as if giants had built the walls; and on these the building arose, and it seemed as if countless hands were working invisibly, and placing one stone upon another. There was a dull heavy noise from the ground; pillars arose of their own accord on high, and placed themselves in order near each other. The tiles laid themselves in order on the roof, and when noon-day came, the great weather-cock was already turning itself on the summit of the tower, like a golden figure of the Virgin with fluttering garments. The inside of the castle was being finished while evening was drawing near. How the old woman managed it, I know not; but the walls of the rooms were hung with silk and velvet, embroidered chairs were there, and richly ornamented arm-chairs by marble tables; crystal chandeliers hung down from the ceilings, and mirrored themselves in the smooth pavement; green parrots were there in gilt cages, and so were strange birds which sang most beautifully, and there was on all sides as much magnificence as if a king were going to live there. The sun was just setting when the girl awoke, and the brightness of a thousand lights flashed in her face. She hurried to the castle, and entered by the open door. The steps were spread with red cloth, and the golden balustrade beset with flowering trees. When she saw the splendour of the apartment, she stood as if turned to stone. Who knows how long she might have stood there if she had not remembered the step-mother? \"Alas!\" she said to herself, \"if she could but be satisfied at last, and would give up making my life a misery to me.\" The girl went and told her that the castle was ready. \"I will move into it at once,\" said she, and rose from her seat. When they entered the castle, she was forced to hold her hand before her eyes, the brilliancy of everything was so dazzling. \"Thou seest,\" said she to the girl, \"how easy it has been for thee to do this; I ought to have given thee something harder.\" She went through all the rooms, and examined every corner to see if anything was wanting or defective; but she could discover nothing. \"Now we will go down below,\" said she, looking at the girl with malicious eyes. \"The kitchen and the cellar still have to be examined, and if thou hast forgotten anything thou shalt not escape thy punishment.\" But the fire was burning on the hearth, and the meat was cooking in the pans, the tongs and shovel were leaning against the wall, and the shining brazen utensils all arranged in sight. Nothing was wanting, not even a coal-box and water-pail. \"Which is the way to the cellar?\" she cried. \"If that is not abundantly filled, it shall go ill with thee.\" She herself raised up the trap-door and descended; but she had hardly made two steps before the heavy trap-door which was only laid back, fell down. The girl heard a scream, lifted up the door very quickly to go to her aid, but she had fallen down, and the girl found her lying lifeless at the bottom.\n\nAnd now the magnificent castle belonged to the girl alone. She at first did not know how to reconcile herself to her good fortune. Beautiful dresses were hanging in the wardrobes, the chests were filled with gold or silver, or with pearls and jewels, and she never felt a desire that she was not able to gratify. And soon the fame of the beauty and riches of the maiden went over all the world. Wooers presented themselves daily, but none pleased her. At length the son of the King came and he knew how to touch her heart, and she betrothed herself to him. In the garden of the castle was a lime-tree, under which they were one day sitting together, when he said to her, \"I will go home and obtain my father\'s consent to our marriage. I entreat thee to wait for me here under this lime-tree, I shall be back with thee in a few hours.\" The maiden kissed him on his left cheek, and said, \"Keep true to me, and never let any one else kiss thee on this cheek. I will wait here under the lime-tree until thou returnest.\n\nThe maid stayed beneath the lime-tree until sunset, but he did not return. She sat three days from morning till evening, waiting for him, but in vain. As he still was not there by the fourth day, she said, \"Some accident has assuredly befallen him. I will go out and seek him, and will not come back until I have found him.\" She packed up three of her most beautiful dresses, one embroidered with bright stars, the second with silver moons, the third with golden suns, tied up a handful of jewels in her handkerchief, and set out. She inquired everywhere for her betrothed, but no one had seen him; no one knew anything about him. Far and wide did she wander through the world, but she found him not. At last she hired herself to a farmer as a cow-herd, and buried her dresses and jewels beneath a stone.\n\nAnd now she lived as a herdswoman, guarded her herd, and was very sad and full of longing for her beloved one; she had a little calf which she taught to know her, and fed it out of her own hand, and when she said,\n\n\"Little calf, little calf, kneel by my side,\nAnd do not forget thy shepherd-maid,\nAs the prince forgot his betrothed bride,\nWho waited for him \'neath the lime-tree\'s shade.\"\nthe little calf knelt down, and she stroked it.\nAnd when she had lived for a couple of years alone and full of grief, a report was spread over all the land that the King\'s daughter was about to celebrate her marriage. The road to the town passed through the village where the maiden was living, and it came to pass that once when the maiden was driving out her herd, her bridegroom travelled by. He was sitting proudly on his horse, and never looked round, but when she saw him she recognized her beloved, and it was just as if a sharp knife had pierced her heart. \"Alas!\" said she, \"I believed him true to me, but he has forgotten me.\"\n\nNext day he again came along the road. When he was near her she said to the little calf,\n\n\"Little calf, little calf, kneel by my side,\nAnd do not forget thy shepherd-maid,\nAs the prince forgot his betrothed bride,\nWho waited for him \'neath the lime-tree\'s shade.\"\nWhen he was aware of the voice, he looked down and reined in his horse. He looked into the herd\'s face, and then put his hands before his eyes as if he were trying to remember something, but he soon rode onwards and was out of sight. \"Alas!\" said she, \"he no longer knows me,\" and her grief was ever greater.\nSoon after this a great festival three days long was to be held at the King\'s court, and the whole country was invited to it.\n\n\"Now will I try my last chance,\" thought the maiden, and when evening came she went to the stone under which she had buried her treasures. She took out the dress with the golden suns, put it on, and adorned herself with the jewels. She let down her hair, which she had concealed under a handkerchief, and it fell down in long curls about her, and thus she went into the town, and in the darkness was observed by no one. When she entered the brightly-lighted hall, every one started back in amazement, but no one knew who she was. The King\'s son went to meet her, but he did not recognize her. He led her out to dance, and was so enchanted with her beauty, that he thought no more of the other bride. When the feast was over, she vanished in the crowd, and hastened before daybreak to the village, where she once more put on her herd\'s dress.\n\nNext evening she took out the dress with the silver moons, and put a half-moon made of precious stones in her hair. When she appeared at the festival, all eyes were turned upon her, but the King\'s son hastened to meet her, and filled with love for her, danced with her alone, and no longer so much as glanced at anyone else. Before she went away she was forced to promise him to come again to the festival on the last evening.\n\nWhen she appeared for the third time, she wore the star-dress which sparkled at every step she took, and her hair-ribbon and girdle were starred with jewels. The prince had already been waiting for her for a long time, and forced his way up to her. \"Do but tell who thou art,\" said he, \"I feel just as if I had already known thee a long time.\" - \"Dost thou not know what I did when thou leftest me?\" Then she stepped up to him, and kissed him on his left cheek, and in a moment it was as if scales fell from his eyes, and he recognized the true bride. \"Come,\" said he to her, \"here I stay no longer,\" gave her his hand, and led her down to the carriage. The horses hurried away to the magic castle as if the wind had been harnessed to the carriage. The illuminated windows already shone in the distance. When they drove past the lime-tree, countless glow-worms were swarming about it. It shook its branches, and sent forth their fragrance. On the steps flowers were blooming, and the room echoed with the song of strange birds, but in the hall the entire court was assembled, and the priest was waiting to marry the bridegroom to the true bride.</string>
    <string name="story455text">There was once on a time an old king who was ill, and thought to himself, \"I am lying on what must be my death-bed.\" Then said he, \" Tell Faithful John to come to me.\" Faithful John was his favourite servant, and was so called, because he had for his whole life long been so true to him. When therefore he came beside the bed, the King said to him, \"Most faithful John, I feel my end approaching, and have no anxiety except about my son. He is still of tender age, and cannot always know how to guide himself. If thou dost not promise me to teach him everything that he ought to know, and to be his foster-father, I cannot close my eyes in peace.\" Then answered Faithful John, \"I will not forsake him, and will serve him with fidelity, even if it should cost me my life.\" On this, the old King said, \"Now I die in comfort and peace.\" Then he added, \"After my death, thou shalt show him the whole castle: all the chambers, halls, and vaults, and all the treasures which lie therein, but the last chamber in the long gallery, in which is the picture of the princess of the Golden Dwelling, shalt thou not show. If he sees that picture, he will fall violently in love with her, and will drop down in a swoon, and go through great danger for her sake, therefore thou must preserve him from that.\" And when Faithful John had once more given his promise to the old King about this, the King said no more, but laid his head on his pillow, and died.\n\nWhen the old King had been carried to his grave, Faithful John told the young King all that he had promised his father on his deathbed, and said, \"This will I assuredly perform, and will be faithful to thee as I have been faithful to him, even if it should cost me my life.\" When the mourning was over, Faithful John said to him, \"It is now time that thou shouldst see thine inheritance. I will show thee thy father\'s palace.\" Then he took him about everywhere, up and down, and let him see all the riches, and the magnificent apartments, only there was one room which he did not open, that in which hung the dangerous picture. The picture was, however, so placed that when the door was opened you looked straight on it, and it was so admirably painted that it seemed to breathe and live, and there was nothing more charming or more beautiful in the whole world. The young King, however, plainly remarked that Faithful John always walked past this one door, and said, \"Why dost thou never open this one for me?\" - \"There is something within it,\" he replied, \"which would terrify thee.\" But the King answered, \"I have seen all the palace, and I will know what is in this room also,\" and he went and tried to break open the door by force. Then Faithful John held him back and said, \"I promised thy father before his death that thou shouldst not see that which is in this chamber, it might bring the greatest misfortune on thee and on me.\" - \"Ah, no,\" replied the young King, \"if I do not go in, it will be my certain destruction. I should have no rest day or night until I had seen it with my own eyes. I shall not leave the place now until thou hast unlocked the door.\"\n\nThen Faithful John saw that there was no help for it now, and with a heavy heart and many sighs, sought out the key from the great bunch. When he had opened the door, he went in first, and thought by standing before him he could hide the portrait so that the King should not see it in front of him, but what availed that? The King stood on tip-toe and saw it over his shoulder. And when he saw the portrait of the maiden, which was so magnificent and shone with gold and precious stones, he fell fainting to the ground. Faithful John took him up, carried him to his bed, and sorrowfully thought, \"The misfortune has befallen us, Lord God, what will be the end of it?\" Then he strengthened him with wine, until he came to himself again. The first words the King said were, \"Ah, the beautiful portrait! whose is it?\" - \"That is the princess of the Golden Dwelling,\" answered Faithful John. Then the King continued, \"My love for her is so great, that if all the leaves on all the trees were tongues, they could not declare it. I will give my life to win her. Thou art my most Faithful John, thou must help me.\"\n\nThe faithful servant considered within himself for a long time how to set about the matter, for it was difficult even to obtain a sight of the King\'s daughter. At length he thought of a way, and said to the King, \"Everything which she has about her is of gold - tables, chairs, dishes, glasses, bowls, and household furniture. Among thy treasures are five tons of gold; let one of the goldsmiths of the Kingdom work these up into all manner of vessels and utensils, into all kinds of birds, wild beasts and strange animals, such as may please her, and we will go there with them and try our luck.\" The King ordered all the goldsmiths to be brought to him, and they had to work night and day until at last the most splendid things were prepared. When everything was stowed on board a ship, Faithful John put on the dress of a merchant, and the King was forced to do the same in order to make himself quite unrecognizable. Then they sailed across the sea, and sailed on until they came to the town wherein dwelt the princess of the Golden Dwelling.\n\nFaithful John bade the King stay behind on the ship, and wait for him. \"Perhaps I shall bring the princess with me,\" said he, \"therefore see that everything is in order; have the golden vessels set out and the whole ship decorated.\" Then he gathered together in his apron all kinds of gold things, went on shore and walked straight to the royal palace. When he entered the courtyard of the palace, a beautiful girl was standing there by the well with two golden buckets in her hand, drawing water with them. And when she was just turning round to carry away the sparkling water she saw the stranger, and asked who he was. So he answered, \"I am a merchant,\" and opened his apron, and let her look in. Then she cried, \"Oh, what beautiful gold things!\" and put her pails down and looked at the golden wares one after the other. Then said the girl, \"The princess must see these, she has such great pleasure in golden things, that she will buy all you have.\" She took him by the hand and led him upstairs, for she was the waiting-maid. When the King\'s daughter saw the wares, she was quite delighted and said, \"They are so beautifully worked, that I will buy them all of thee.\" But Faithful John said, \"I am only the servant of a rich merchant. The things I have here are not to be compared with those my master has in his ship. They are the most beautiful and valuable things that have ever been made in gold.\" She wanted to have everything brought to her there, but he said, \"There are so many of them that it would take a great many days to do that, and so many rooms would be required to exhibit them, that your house is not big enough.\" Then her curiosity and longing were still more excited, until at last she said, \"Conduct me to the ship, I will go there myself, and behold the treasures of thine master.\"\n\nOn this Faithful John was quite delighted, and led her to the ship, and when the King saw her, he perceived that her beauty was even greater than the picture had represented it to be, and thought no other than that his heart would burst in twain. Then she got into the ship, and the King led her within. Faithful John, however, remained behind with the pilot, and ordered the ship to be pushed off, saying, \"Set all sail, till it fly like a bird in air.\" Within, however, the King showed her the golden vessels, every one of them, also the wild beasts and strange animals. Many hours went by whilst she was seeing everything, and in her delight she did not observe that the ship was sailing away. After she had looked at the last, she thanked the merchant and wanted to go home, but when she came to the side of the ship, she saw that it was on the deep sea far from land, and hurrying onwards with all sail set. \"Ah,\" cried she in her alarm, \"I am betrayed! I am carried away and have fallen into the power of a merchant - I would die rather!\" The King, however, seized her hand, and said, \"I am not a merchant. I am a king, and of no meaner origin than thou art, and if I have carried thee away with subtlety, that has come to pass because of my exceeding great love for thee. The first time that I looked on thy portrait, I fell fainting to the ground.\" When the princess of the Golden Dwelling heard that, she was comforted, and her heart was inclined unto him, so that she willingly consented to be his wife.\n\nIt so happened, however, while they were sailing onwards over the deep sea, that Faithful John, who was sitting on the fore part of the vessel, making music, saw three ravens in the air, which came flying towards them. On this he stopped playing and listened to what they were saying to each other, for that he well understood. One cried, \"Oh, there he is carrying home the princess of the Golden Dwelling.\" - \"Yes,\" replied the second, \"but he has not got her yet.\" Said the third, \"But he has got her, she is sitting beside him in the ship.\" Then the first began again, and cried, \"What good will that do him? When they reach land a chestnut horse will leap forward to meet him, and the prince will want to mount it, but if he does that, it will run away with him, and rise up into the air with him, and he will never see his maiden more.\" Spake the second, \"But is there no escape?\" - \"Oh, yes, if any one else gets on it swiftly, and takes out the pistol which must be in its holster, and shoots the horse dead with it, the young King is saved. But who knows that? And whosoever does know it, and tells it to him, will be turned to stone from the toe to the knee.\" Then said the second, \"I know more than that; even if the horse be killed, the young King will still not keep his bride. When they go into the castle together, a wrought bridal garment will be lying there in a dish, and looking as if it were woven of gold and silver; it is, however, nothing but sulphur and pitch, and if he put it on, it will burn him to the very bone and marrow.\" Said the third, \"Is there no escape at all?\" - \"Oh, yes,\" replied the second, \"if any one with gloves on seizes the garment and throws it into the fire and burns it, the young King will be saved. \"But what avails that?\" Whosoever knows it and tells it to him, half his body will become stone from the knee to the heart.\" Then said the third, \"I know still more; even if the bridal garment be burnt, the young King will still not have his bride. After the wedding, when the dancing begins and the young queen is dancing, she will suddenly turn pale and fall down as if dead, and if some one does not lift her up and draw three drops of blood from her right breast and spit them out again, she will die. But if any one who knows that were to declare it, he would become stone from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot.\" When the ravens had spoken of this together, they flew onwards, and Faithful John had well understood everything, but from that time forth he became quiet and sad, for if he concealed what he had heard from his master, the latter would be unfortunate, and if he discovered it to him, he himself must sacrifice his life. At length, however, he said to himself, \"I will save my master, even if it bring destruction on myself.\"\n\nWhen therefore they came to shore, all happened as had been foretold by the ravens, and a magnificent chestnut horse sprang forward. \"Good,\" said the King, \"he shall carry me to my palace,\" and was about to mount it when Faithful John got before him, jumped quickly on it, drew the pistol out of the holster, and shot the horse. Then the other attendants of the King, who after all were not very fond of Faithful John, cried, \"How shameful to kill the beautiful animal, that was to have carried the King to his palace.\" But the King said, \"Hold your peace and leave him alone, he is my most faithful John, who knows what may be the good of that!\" They went into the palace, and in the hall there stood a dish, and therein lay the bridal garment looking no otherwise than as if it were made of gold and silver. The young King went towards it and was about to take hold of it, but Faithful John pushed him away, seized it with gloves on, carried it quickly to the fire and burnt it. The other attendants again began to murmur, and said, \"Behold, now he is even burning the King\'s bridal garment!\" But the young King said, \"Who knows what good he may have done, leave him alone, he is my most faithful John.\" And now the wedding was solemnized: the dance began, and the bride also took part in it; then Faithful John was watchful and looked into her face, and suddenly she turned pale and fell to the ground, as if she were dead. On this he ran hastily to her, lifted her up and bore her into a chamber - then he laid her down, and knelt and sucked the three drops of blood from her right breast, and spat them out. Immediately she breathed again and recovered herself, but the young King had seen this, and being ignorant why Faithful John had done it, was angry and cried, \"Throw him into a dungeon.\" Next morning Faithful John was condemned, and led to the gallows, and when he stood on high, and was about to be executed, he said, \"Every one who has to die is permitted before his end to make one last speech; may I too claim the right?\" - \"Yes,\" answered the King, \"it shall be granted unto thee.\" Then said Faithful John, \"I am unjustly condemned, and have always been true to thee,\" and he related how he had hearkened to the conversation of the ravens when on the sea, and how he had been obliged to do all these things in order to save his master. Then cried the King, \"Oh, my most Faithful John. Pardon, pardon - bring him down.\" But as Faithful John spoke the last word he had fallen down lifeless and become a stone.\n\nThereupon the King and the Queen suffered great anguish, and the King said, \"Ah, how ill I have requited great fidelity!\" and ordered the stone figure to be taken up and placed in his bedroom beside his bed. And as often as he looked on it he wept and said, \"Ah, if I could bring thee to life again, my most faithful John.\" Some time passed and the Queen bore twins, two sons who grew fast and were her delight. Once when the Queen was at church and the two children were sitting playing beside their father, the latter full of grief again looked at the stone figure, sighed and said, \"Ah, if I could but bring thee to life again, my most faithful John.\" Then the stone began to speak and said, \"Thou canst bring me to life again if thou wilt use for that purpose what is dearest to thee.\" Then cried the King, \"I will give everything I have in the world for thee.\" The stone continued, \"If thou wilt will cut off the heads of thy two children with thine own hand, and sprinkle me with their blood, I shall be restored to life.\" The King was terrified when he heard that he himself must kill his dearest children, but he thought of faithful John\'s great fidelity, and how he had died for him, drew his sword, and with his own hand cut off the children\'s heads. And when he had smeared the stone with their blood, life returned to it, and Faithful John stood once more safe and healthy before him. He said to the King, \"Thy truth shall not go unrewarded,\" and took the heads of the children, put them on again, and rubbed the wounds with their blood, on which they became whole again immediately, and jumped about, and went on playing as if nothing had happened. Then the King was full of joy, and when he saw the Queen coming he hid Faithful John and the two children in a great cupboard. When she entered, he said to her, \"Hast thou been praying in the church?\" - \"Yes,\" answered she, \"but I have constantly been thinking of Faithful John and what misfortune has befallen him through us.\" Then said he, \"Dear wife, we can give him his life again, but it will cost us our two little sons, whom we must sacrifice.\" The Queen turned pale, and her heart was full of terror, but she said, \"We owe it to him, for his great fidelity.\" Then the King was rejoiced that she thought as he had thought, and went and opened the cupboard, and brought forth Faithful John and the children, and said, \"God be praised, he is delivered, and we have our little sons again also,\" and told her how everything had occurred. Then they dwelt together in much happiness until their death.</string>
    <string name="story456text">There were once two brothers who both served as soldiers; one of them was rich, and the other poor. Then the poor one, to escape from his poverty, put off his soldier\'s coat, and turned farmer. He dug and hoed his bit of land, and sowed it with turnip-seed. The seed came up, and one turnip grew there which became large and vigorous, and visibly grew bigger and bigger, and seemed as if it would never stop growing, so that it might have been called the princess of turnips, for never was such an one seen before, and never will such an one be seen again.\nAt length it was so enormous that by itself it filled a whole cart, and two oxen were required to draw it, and the farmer had not the least idea what he was to do with the turnip, or whether it would be a fortune to him or a misfortune. At last he thought, \"If thou sellest it, what wilt thou get for it that is of any importance, and if thou eatest it thyself, why, the small turnips would do thee just as much good; it would be better to take it to the King, and make him a present of it.\"\n\nSo he placed it on a cart, harnessed two oxen, took it to the palace, and presented it to the King. \"What strange thing is this?\" said the King. \"Many wonderful things have come before my eyes, but never such a monster as this! From what seed can this have sprung, or are you a luck-child and have met with it by chance?\" - \"Ah, no!\" said the farmer, \"no luck-child am I. I am a poor soldier, who because he could no longer support himself hung his soldier\'s coat on a nail and took to farming land. I have a brother who is rich and well known to you, Lord King, but I, because I have nothing, am forgotten by every one.\"\n\nThen the King felt compassion for him, and said, \"Thou shalt be raised from thy poverty, and shalt have such gifts from me that thou shalt be equal to thy rich brother.\" Then he bestowed on him much gold, and lands, and meadows, and herds, and made him immensely rich, so that the wealth of the other brother could not be compared with his. When the rich brother heard what the poor one had gained for himself with one single turnip, he envied him, and thought in every way how he also could get hold of a similar piece of luck. He would, however, set about it in a much wiser way, and took gold and horses and carried them to the King, and made certain the King would give him a much larger present in return. If his brother had got so much for one turnip, what would he not carry away with him in return for such beautiful things as these? The King accepted his present, and said he had nothing to give him in return that was more rare and excellent than the great turnip. So the rich man was obliged to put his brother\'s turnip in a cart and have it taken to his home. When there he did not know on whom to vent his rage and anger, until bad thoughts came to him, and he resolved to kill his brother. He hired murderers, who were to lie in ambush, and then he went to his brother and said, \"Dear brother, I know of a hidden treasure, we will dig it up together, and divide it between us.\" The other agreed to this, and accompanied him without suspicion. While they were on their way, however, the murderers fell on him, bound him, and would have hanged him to a tree. But just as they were doing this, loud singing and the sound of a horse\'s feet were heard in the distance. On this their hearts were filled with terror, and they pushed their prisoner head first into the sack, hung it on a branch, and took to flight. He, however, worked up there until he had made a hole in the sack through which he could put his head. The man who was coming by was no other than a travelling student, a young fellow who rode on his way through the wood joyously singing his song. When he who was aloft saw that someone was passing below him, he cried, \"Good day! You have come at a lucky time.\" The student looked round on every side, but did not know whence the voice came. At last he said, \"Who calls me?\" Then an answer came from the top of the tree, \"Raise your eyes; here I sit aloft in the Sack of Wisdom. In a short time have I learnt great things; compared with this all schools are a jest; in a very short time I shall have learnt everything, and shall descend wiser than all other men. I understand the stars, and the signs of the Zodiac, and the tracks of the winds, the sand of the sea, the healing of illness, and the virtues of all herbs, birds, and stones. If you were once within it you would feel what noble things issue forth from the Sack of Knowledge.\"\n\nThe student, when he heard all this, was astonished, and said, \"Blessed be the hour in which I have found thee! May not I also enter the sack for a while?\" He who was above replied as if unwillingly, \"For a short time I will let you get into it, if you reward me and give me good words; but you must wait an hour longer, for one thing remains which I must learn before I do it.\" When the student had waited a while he became impatient, and begged to be allowed to get in at once, his thirst for knowledge was so very great. So he who was above pretended at last to yield, and said, \"In order that I may come forth from the house of knowledge you must let it down by the rope, and then you shall enter it.\" So the student let the sack down, untied it, and set him free, and then cried, \"Now draw me up at once,\" and was about to get into the sack. \"Halt!\" said the other, \"that won\'t do,\" and took him by the head and put him upside down into the sack, fastened it, and drew the disciple of wisdom up the tree by the rope. Then he swung him in the air and said, \"How goes it with thee, my dear fellow? Behold, already thou feelest wisdom coming, and art gaining valuable experience. Keep perfectly quiet until thou becomest wiser.\" Thereupon he mounted the student\'s horse and rode away, but in an hour\'s time sent some one to let the student out again.</string>
    <string name="story457text">There were once on a time a king and a queen who lived happily together and had twelve children, but they were all boys. Then said the King to his wife, \"If the thirteenth child which thou art about to bring into the world, is a girl, the twelve boys shall die, in order that her possessions may be great, and that the kingdom may fall to her alone.\" He caused likewise twelve coffins to be made, which were already filled with shavings, and in each lay the little pillow for the dead, and he had them taken into a locked-up room, and then he gave the Queen the key of it, and bade her not to speak of this to any one.\n\nThe mother, however, now sat and lamented all day long, until the youngest son, who was always with her, and whom she had named Benjamin, from the Bible, said to her, \"Dear mother, why art thou so sad?\"\n\n\"Dearest child,\" she answered, \"I may not tell thee.\" But he let her have no rest until she went and unlocked the room, and showed him the twelve coffins ready filled with shavings. Then she said, my dearest Benjamin, thy father has had these coffins made for thee and for thy eleven brothers, for if I bring a little girl into the world, you are all to be killed and buried in them.\" And as she wept while she was saying this, the son comforted her and said, \"Weep not, dear mother, we will save ourselves, and go hence.\" But she said, \"Go forth into the forest with thy eleven brothers, and let one sit constantly on the highest tree which can be found, and keep watch, looking towards the tower here in the castle. If I give birth to a little son, I will put up a white flag, and then you may venture to come back, but if I bear a daughter, I will hoist a red flag, and then fly hence as quickly as you are able, and may the good God protect you. And every night I will rise up and pray for you — in winter that you may be able to warm yourself at a fire, and in summer that you may not faint away in the heat.\"\n\nAfter she had blessed her sons therefore, they went forth into the forest. They each kept watch in turn, and sat on the highest oak and looked towards the tower. When eleven days had passed and the turn came to Benjamin, he saw that a flag was being raised. It was, however, not the white, but the blood-red flag which announced that they were all to die. When the brothers heard that, they were very angry and said, \"Are we all to suffer death for the sake of a girl? We swear that we will avenge ourselves!— wheresoever we find a girl, her red blood shall flow.\"\n\nThereupon they went deeper into the forest, and in the midst of it, where it was the darkest, they found a little bewitched hut, which was standing empty. Then said they, \"Here we will dwell, and thou Benjamin, who art the youngest and weakest, thou shalt stay at home and keep house, we others will go out and get food.\" Then they went into the forest and shot hares, wild deer, birds and pigeons, and whatsoever there was to eat; this they took to Benjamin, who had to dress it for them in order that they might appease their hunger. They lived together ten years in the little hut, and the time did not appear long to them.\n\nThe little daughter which their mother the Queen had given birth to, was now grown up; she was good of heart, and fair of face, and had a golden star on her forehead. Once, when it was the great washing, she saw twelve men\'s shirts among the things, and asked her mother, \"To whom do these twelve shirts belong, for they are far too small for father?\" Then the Queen answered with a heavy heart, \"Dear child, these belong to thy twelve brothers.\" Said the maiden, \"Where are my twelve brothers, I have never yet heard of them?\" She replied, \"God knows where they are, they are wandering about the world.\" Then she took the maiden and opened the chamber for her, and showed her the twelve coffins with the shavings, and pillows for the head. \"These coffins,\" said she, \"were destined for thy brothers, but they went away secretly before thou wert born,\" and she related to her how everything had happened; then said the maiden, \"Dear mother, weep not, I will go and seek my brothers.\"\n\nSo she took the twelve shirts and went forth, and straight into the great forest. She walked the whole day, and in the evening she came to the bewitched hut. Then she entered it and found a young boy, who asked, \"From whence comest thou, and whither art thou bound?\" and was astonished that she was so beautiful, and wore royal garments, and had a star on her forehead. And she answered, \"I am a king\'s daughter, and am seeking my twelve brothers, and I will walk as far as the sky is blue until I find them.\" She likewise showed him the twelve shirts which belonged to them. Then Benjamin saw that she was his sister, and said, \"I am Benjamin, thy youngest brother.\" And she began to weep for joy, and Benjamin wept also, and they kissed and embraced each other with the greatest love. But after this he said, \"Dear sister, there is still one difficulty. We have agreed that every maiden whom we meet shall die, because we have been obliged to leave our kingdom on account of a girl.\" Then said she, \"I will willingly die, if by so doing I can deliver my twelve brothers.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered he, \"thou shalt not die, seat thyself beneath this tub until our eleven brothers come, and then I will soon come to an agreement with them.\"\n\nShe did so, and when it was night the others came from hunting, and their dinner was ready. And as they were sitting at table, and eating, they asked, \"What news is there?\" Said Benjamin, \"Don\'t you know anything?\" - \"No,\" they answered. He continued, \"You have been in the forest and I have stayed at home, and yet I know more than you do.\" - \"Tell us then,\" they cried. He answered, \"But promise me that the first maiden who meets us shall not be killed.\" - \"Yes,\" they all cried, \"she shall have mercy, only do tell us.\"\n\nThen said he, \"Our sister is here,\" and he lifted up the tub, and the King\'s daughter came forth in her royal garments with the golden star on her forehead, and she was beautiful, delicate and fair. Then they were all rejoiced, and fell on her neck, and kissed and loved her with all their hearts.\n\nNow she stayed at home with Benjamin and helped him with the work. The eleven went into the forest and caught game, and deer, and birds, and wood-pigeons that they might have food, and the little sister and Benjamin took care to make it ready for them. She sought for the wood for cooking and herbs for vegetables, and put the pans on the fire so that the dinner was always ready when the eleven came. She likewise kept order in the little house, and put beautifully white clean coverings on the little beds, and the brothers were always contented and lived in great harmony with her.\n\nOnce on a time the two at home had prepared a beautiful entertainment, and when they were all together, they sat down and ate and drank and were full of gladness. There was, however, a little garden belonging to the bewitched house wherein stood twelve lily flowers, which are likewise called students. She wished to give her brothers pleasure, and plucked the twelve flowers, and thought she would present each brother with one while at dinner. But at the self-same moment that she plucked the flowers the twelve brothers were changed into twelve ravens, and flew away over the forest, and the house and garden vanished likewise. And now the poor maiden was alone in the wild forest, and when she looked around, an old woman was standing near her who said, \"My child, what hast thou done? Why didst thou not leave the twelve white flowers growing? They were thy brothers, who are now for evermore changed into ravens.\" The maiden said, weeping, \"Is there no way of delivering them?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the woman, \"there is but one in the whole world, and that is so hard that thou wilt not deliver them by it, for thou must be dumb for seven years, and mayst not speak or laugh, and if thou speakest one single word, and only an hour of the seven years is wanting, all is in vain, and thy brothers will be killed by the one word.\"\n\nThen said the maiden in her heart, \"I know with certainty that I shall set my brothers free,\" and went and sought a high tree and seated herself in it and span, and neither spoke nor laughed. Now it so happened that a king was hunting in the forest, who had a great greyhound which ran to the tree on which the maiden was sitting, and sprang about it, whining, and barking at her. Then the King came by and saw the beautiful King\'s daughter with the golden star on her brow, and was so charmed with her beauty that he called to ask her if she would be his wife. She made no answer, but nodded a little with her head. So he climbed up the tree himself, carried her down, placed her on his horse, and bore her home. Then the wedding was solemnized with great magnificence and rejoicing, but the bride neither spoke nor smiled. When they had lived happily together for a few years, the King\'s mother, who was a wicked woman, began to slander the young Queen, and said to the King, \"This is a common beggar girl whom thou hast brought back with thee. Who knows what impious tricks she practises secretly! Even if she be dumb, and not able to speak, she still might laugh for once; but those who do not laugh have bad consciences.\" At first the King would not believe it, but the old woman urged this so long, and accused her of so many evil things, that at last the King let himself be persuaded and sentenced her to death.\n\nAnd now a great fire was lighted in the courtyard in which she was to be burnt, and the King stood above at the window and looked on with tearful eyes, because he still loved her so much. And when she was bound fast to the stake, and the fire was licking at her clothes with its red tongue, the last instant of the seven years expired. Then a whirring sound was heard in the air, and twelve ravens came flying towards the place, and sank downwards, and when they touched the earth they were her twelve brothers, whom she had delivered. They tore the fire asunder, extinguished the flames, set their dear sister free, and kissed and embraced her. And now as she dared to open her mouth and speak, she told the King why she had been dumb, and had never laughed. The King rejoiced when he heard that she was innocent, and they all lived in great unity until their death. The wicked step-mother was taken before the judge, and put into a barrel filled with boiling oil and venomous snakes, and died an evil death.</string>
    <string name="story458text">There was once a King\'s son who was betrothed to a maiden whom he loved very much. And when he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father lay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end. Then he said to his beloved, \"I must now go and leave thee, I give thee a ring as a remembrance of me. When I am King, I will return and fetch thee.\" So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was dangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him, \"Dear son, I wished to see thee once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,\" and he named a certain King\'s daughter who was to be his wife. The son was in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said, \"Yes, dear father, your will shall be done,\" and thereupon the King shut his eyes, and died.\nWhen therefore the son had been proclaimed King, and the time of mourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given his father, and caused the King\'s daughter to be asked in marriage, and she was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted so much about his faithlessness that she nearly died. Then her father said to her, \"Dearest child, why art thou so sad? Thou shalt have whatsoever thou wilt.\" She thought for a moment and said, \"Dear father, I wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.\" The father said, \"If it be possible, thy desire shall be fulfilled,\" and he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven young maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face, figure, and size.\n\nWhen they came to the King\'s daughter, she had twelve suits of huntsmen\'s clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put on the huntsmen\'s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit. Thereupon she took leave of her father, and rode away with them, and rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly. Then she inquired if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take the whole of them into his service. The King looked at her and did not know her, but as they were such handsome fellows, he said, \"Yes,\" and that he would willingly take them, and now they were the King\'s twelve huntsmen.\n\nThe King, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he said to the King, \"Thou thinkest thou hast twelve huntsmen?\" - \"Yes,\" said the King, \"they are twelve huntsmen.\" The lion continued, \"Thou art mistaken, they are twelve girls.\" The King said, \"That cannot be true! How wilt thou prove that to me?\" - \"Oh, just let some peas be strewn in thy ante-chamber,\" answered the lion, \"and then thou wilt soon see it. Men have a firm step, and when they walk over the peas none of them stir, but girls trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.\" The King was well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.\n\nThere was, however, a servant of the King\'s who favored the huntsmen, and when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to them and repeated everything, and said, \"The lion wants to make the King believe that you are girls.\" Then the King\'s daughter thanked him, and said to her maidens, \"Put on some strength, and step firmly on the peas.\" So next morning when the King had the twelve huntsmen called before him, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they stepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not one of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again, and the King said to the lion, \"Thou hast lied to me, they walk just like men.\" The lion said, \"They have got to know that they were going to be put to the test, and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve spinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber some day, and they will go to them and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.\" The King liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber.\n\nBut the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them, and disclosed the project. Then when they were alone the King\'s daughter said to her eleven girls, \"Put some constraint on yourselves, and do not look round at the spinning-wheels.\" And next morning when the King had his twelve huntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once looked at the spinning wheels. Then the King again said to the lion, \"Thou hast deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the spinning-wheels.\" The lion replied, \"They have learnt that they were going to be put to the test, and have restrained themselves.\" The King, however, would no longer believe the lion.\n\nThe twelve huntsmen always followed the King to the chase, and his liking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that once when they were out hunting, news came that the King\'s betrothed was approaching. When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that her heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The King thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him, wanted to help him, and drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring which he had given to his first bride, and when he looked in her face he recognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and when she opened her eyes he said, \"Thou art mine, and I am thine, and no one in the world can alter that.\" He sent a messenger to the other bride, and entreated her to return to her own kingdom, for he had a wife already, and a man who had just found an old dish did not require a new one. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again taken into favour, because, after all, he had told the truth.</string>
    <string name="story459text">Twelve servants who had done nothing all the day would not exert themselves at night either, but laid themselves on the grass and boasted of their idleness. The first said, \"What is your laziness to me, I have to concern myself about mine own? The care of my body is my principal work, I eat not a little and drink still more. When I have had four meals, I fast a short time until I feel hunger again, and that suits me best. To rise betimes is not for me; when it is getting near mid-day, I already seek out a resting-place for myself. If the master call, I do exactly as if I had not heard him, and if he call for the second time, I wait awhile before I get up, and go to him very slowly. In this way life is endurable.\"\nThe second said, \"I have a horse to look after, but I leave the bit in his mouth, and if I do not want to do it, I give him no food, and I say he has had it already. I, however, lay myself in the oat-chest and sleep for four hours. After this I stretch out one foot and move it a couple of times over the horse\'s body, and then he is combed and cleaned. Who is going to make a great business of that? Nevertheless service is too toilsome for me.\"\n\nThe third said, \"Why plague oneself with work? Nothing comes of it! I laid myself in the sun, and fell asleep. It began to rain a little, but why should I get up? I let it rain on in God\'s name. At last came a splashing shower, so heavy indeed, that it pulled the hair out of my head and washed it away, and I got a hole in the skull; I put a plaster on it, and then it was all right. I have already had several injuries of that kind.\"\n\nThe fourth said, \"If I am to undertake a piece of work, I first loiter about for an hour that I may save up my strength. After that I begin quite slowly, and ask if no one is there who could help me. Then I let him do the chief of the work, and in reality only look on; but that also is still too much for me.\"\n\nThe fifth said, \"What does that matter? Just think, I am to take away the manure from the horse\'s stable, and load the cart with it. I let it go on slowly, and if I have taken anything on the fork, I only half-raise it up, and then I rest just a quarter of an hour until I quite throw it in. It is enough and to spare if I take out a cartful in the day. I have no fancy for killing myself with work.\"\n\nThe sixth said, \"Shame on ye; I am afraid of no work, but I lie down for three weeks, and never once take my clothes off. What is the use of buckling your shoes on? For aught I care they may fall off my feet, it is no matter. If I am going up some steps, I drag one foot slowly after the other on to the first step, and then I count the rest of them that I may know where I must rest.\n\nThe seventh said, \"That will not do with me; my master looks after my work, only he is not at home the whole day. But I neglect nothing, I run as fast as it is possible to do when one crawls. If I am to get on, four sturdy men must push me with all their might. I came where six men were lying sleeping on a bed beside each other. I lay down by them and slept too. There was no wakening me again, and when they wanted to have me home, they had to carry me.\" The eighth said, \"I see plainly that I am the only active fellow; if a stone lie before me, I do not give myself the trouble to raise my legs and step over it. I lay myself down on the ground, and if I am wet and covered with mud and dirt, I stay lying until the sun has dried me again. At the very most, I only turn myself so that it can shine on me.\" The ninth said, \"That is the right way! To-day the bread was before me, but I was too idle to take it, and nearly died of hunger! Moreover a jug stood by it, but it was so big and heavy that I did not like to lift it up, and preferred bearing thirst. Just to turn myself round was too much for me, I remained lying like a log the whole day.\" The tenth said, \"Laziness has brought misfortune on me, a broken leg and swollen calf. Three of us were lying in the road, and I had my legs stretched out. Some one came with a cart, and the wheels went over me. I might indeed have drawn my legs back, but I did not hear the cart coming, for the midges were humming about my ears, and creeping in at my nose and out again at my mouth; who can take the trouble to drive the vermin away?\"\n\nThe eleventh said, \"I gave up my place yesterday. I had no fancy for carrying the heavy books to my master any longer or fetching them away again. There was no end of it all day long. But to tell the truth, he gave me my dismissal, and would not keep me any longer, for his clothes, which I had left lying in the dust, were all moth-eaten, and I am very glad of it.\"\n\nThe twelfth said, \"To-day I had to drive the cart into the country, and made myself a bed of straw on it, and had a good sleep. The reins slipped out of my hand, and when I awoke, the horse had nearly torn itself loose, the harness was gone, the strap which fastened the horse to the shafts was gone, and so were the collar, the bridle and bit. Some one had come by, who had carried all off. Besides this, the cart had got into a quagmire and stuck fast. I left it standing, and stretched myself on the straw again. At last the master came himself, and pushed the cart out, and if he had not come I should not be lying here but there, and sleeping in full tranquillity.\"</string>
    <string name="story460text">There were once upon a time two brothers, one rich and the other poor. The rich one was a goldsmith and evil-hearted. The poor one supported himself by making brooms, and was good and honourable. The poor one had two children, who were twin brothers and as like each other as two drops of water. The two boys went backwards and forwards to the rich house, and often got some of the scraps to eat. It happened once when the poor man was going into the forest to fetch brush-wood, that he saw a bird which was quite golden and more beautiful than any he had ever chanced to meet with. He picked up a small stone, threw it at him, and was lucky enough to hit him, but one golden feather only fell down, and the bird flew away. The man took the feather and carried it to his brother, who looked at it and said, \"It is pure gold!\" and gave him a great deal of money for it. Next day the man climbed into a birch-tree, and was about to cut off a couple of branches when the same bird flew out, and when the man searched he found a nest, and an egg lay inside it, which was of gold. He took the egg home with him, and carried it to his brother, who again said, \"It is pure gold,\" and gave him what it was worth. At last the goldsmith said, \"I should indeed like to have the bird itself.\" The poor man went into the forest for the third time, and again saw the golden bird sitting on the tree, so he took a stone and brought it down and carried it to his brother, who gave him a great heap of gold for it. \"Now I can get on,\" thought he, and went contentedly home.\n\nThe goldsmith was crafty and cunning, and knew very well what kind of a bird it was. He called his wife and said, \"Roast me the gold bird, and take care that none of it is lost. I have a fancy to eat it all myself.\" The bird, however, was no common one, but of so wondrous a kind that whosoever ate its heart and liver found every morning a piece of gold beneath his pillow. The woman made the bird ready, put it on the spit, and let it roast. Now it happened that while it was at the fire, and the woman was forced to go out of the kitchen on account of some other work, the two children of the poor broom-maker ran in, stood by the spit and turned it round once or twice. And as at that very moment two little bits of the bird fell down into the dripping-tin, one of the boys said, \"We will eat these two little bits; I am so hungry, and no one will ever miss them.\" Then the two ate the pieces, but the woman came into the kitchen and saw that they were eating something and said, \"What have ye been eating?\" - \"Two little morsels which fell out of the bird,\" answered they. \"That must have been the heart and the liver,\" said the woman, quite frightened, and in order that her husband might not miss them and be angry, she quickly killed a young cock, took out his heart and liver, and put them beside the golden bird. When it was ready, she carried it to the goldsmith, who consumed it all alone, and left none of it. Next morning, however, when he felt beneath his pillow, and expected to bring out the piece of gold, no more gold pieces were there than there had always been.\n\nThe two children did not know what a piece of good-fortune had fallen to their lot. Next morning when they arose, something fell rattling to the ground, and when they picked it up there were two gold pieces! They took them to their father, who was astonished and said, \"How can that have happened?\" When next morning they again found two, and so on daily, he went to his brother and told him the strange story. The goldsmith at once knew how it had come to pass, and that the children had eaten the heart and liver of the golden bird, and in order to revenge himself, and because he was envious and hard-hearted, he said to the father, \"Thy children are in league with the Evil One, do not take the gold, and do not suffer them to stay any longer in thy house, for he has them in his power, and may ruin thee likewise.\" The father feared the Evil One, and painful as it was to him, he nevertheless led the twins forth into the forest, and with a sad heart left them there.</string>
    <string name="story461text">There was once on a time a King who had a little boy of whom it had been foretold that he should be killed by a stag when he was sixteen years of age, and when he had reached that age the huntsmen once went hunting with him. In the forest, the King\'s son was separated from the others, and all at once he saw a great stag which he wanted to shoot, but could not hit. At length he chased the stag so far that they were quite out of the forest, and then suddenly a great tall man was standing there instead of the stag, and said, \"It is well that I have thee. I have already ruined six pairs of glass skates with running after thee, and have not been able to get thee.\" Then he took the King\'s son with him, and dragged him through a great lake to a great palace, and then he had to sit down to table with him and eat something. When they had eaten something together the King said, \"I have three daughters, thou must keep watch over the eldest for one night, from nine in the evening till six in the morning, and every time the clock strikes, I will come myself and call, and if thou then givest me no answer, to-morrow morning thou shall be put to death, but if thou always givest me an answer, thou shalt have her to wife.\"\nWhen the young folks went to the bed-room there stood a stone image of St. Christopher, and the King\'s daughter said to it, \"My father will come at nine o\'clock, and every hour till it strikes three; when he calls, give him an answer instead of the King\'s son.\" Then the stone image of St. Christopher nodded its head quite quickly, and then more and more slowly till at last it stood still. The next morning the King said to him, \"Thou hast done the business well, but I cannot give my daughter away. Thou must now watch a night by my second daughter, and then I will consider with myself, whether thou canst have my eldest daughter to wife, but I shall come every hour myself, and when I call thee, answer me, and if I call thee and thou dost not reply, thy blood shall flow.\" Then they both went into the sleeping-room, and there stood a still larger stone image of St. Christopher, and the King\'s daughter said to it, \"If my father calls, do you answer him.\" Then the great stone image of St. Christopher again nodded its head quite quickly and then more and more slowly, until at last it stood still again. And the King\'s son lay down on the threshold, put his hand under his head and slept. The next morning the King said to him, \"Thou hast done the business really well, but I cannot give my daughter away; thou must now watch a night by the youngest princess, and then I will consider with myself whether thou canst have my second daughter to wife, but I shall come every hour myself, and when I call thee answer me, and if I call thee and thou answerest not, thy blood shall flow for me.\"\n\nThen they once more went to the sleeping-room together, and there was a much greater and much taller image of St. Christopher than the two first had been. The King\'s daughter said to it, \"When my father calls, do thou answer.\" Then the great tall stone image of St. Christopher nodded quite half an hour with its head, until at length the head stood still again. And the King\'s son laid himself down on the threshold of the door and slept. The next morning the King said, \"Thou hast indeed watched well, but I cannot give thee my daughter now; I have a great forest, if thou cuttest it down for me between six o\'clock this morning and six at night, I will think about it.\" Then he gave him a glass axe, a glass wedge, and a glass mallet. When he got into the wood, he began at once to cut, but the axe broke in two, then he took the wedge, and struck it once with the mallet, and it became as short and as small as sand. Then he was much troubled and believed he would have to die, and sat down and wept.\n\nNow when it was noon the King said, \"One of you girls must take him something to eat.\" - \"No,\" said the two eldest, \"We will not take it to him; the one by whom he last watched, can take him something.\" Then the youngest was forced to go and take him something to eat. When she got into the forest, she asked him how he was getting on? \"Oh,\" said he, \"I am getting on very badly.\" Then she said he was to come and just eat a little. \"Nay,\" said he, \"I cannot do that, I shall still have to die, so I will eat no more.\" Then she spoke so kindly to him and begged him just to try, that he came and ate something. When he had eaten something she said, \"I will comb thy hair a while, and then thou wilt feel happier.\"\n\nSo she combed his hair, and he became weary and fell asleep, and then she took her handkerchief and made a knot in it, and struck it three times on the earth, and said, \"Earth-workers, come forth.\" In a moment, numbers of little earth-men came forth, and asked what the King\'s daughter commanded? Then said she, \"In three hours\' time the great forest must be cut down, and the whole of the wood laid in heaps.\" So the little earth-men went about and got together the whole of their kindred to help them with the work. They began at once, and when the three hours were over, all was done, and they came back to the King\'s daughter and told her so. Then she took her white handkerchief again and said, \"Earth-workers, go home.\" On this they all disappeared. When the King\'s son awoke, he was delighted, and she said, \"Come home when it has struck six o\'clock.\" He did as she told him, and then the King asked, \"Hast thou made away with the forest?\" - \"Yes,\" said the King\'s son. When they were sitting at table, the King said, \"I cannot yet give thee my daughter to wife, thou must still do something more for her sake.\" So he asked what it was to be, then? \"I have a great fish-pond,\" said the King. \"Thou must go to it to-morrow morning and clear it of all mud until it is as bright as a mirror, and fill it with every kind of fish.\" The next morning the King gave him a glass shovel and said, \"The fish-pond must be done by six o\'clock.\" So he went away, and when he came to the fish-pond he stuck his shovel in the mud and it broke in two, then he stuck his hoe in the mud, and broke it also. Then he was much troubled. At noon the youngest daughter brought him something to eat, and asked him how he was getting on? So the King\'s son said everything was going very ill with him, and he would certainly have to lose his head. \"My tools have broken to pieces again.\" - \"Oh,\" said she, \"thou must just come and eat something, and then thou wilt be in another frame of mind.\" - \"No,\" said he, \"I cannot eat, I am far too unhappy for that!\" Then she gave him many good words until at last he came and ate something. Then she combed his hair again, and he fell asleep, so once more she took her handkerchief, tied a knot in it, and struck the ground thrice with the knot, and said, \"Earth-workers, come forth.\" In a moment a great many little earth-men came and asked what she desired, and she told them that in three hours\' time, they must have the fish-pond entirely cleaned out, and it must be so clear that people could see themselves reflected in it, and every kind of fish must be in it. The little earth-men went away and summoned all their kindred to help them, and in two hours it was done. Then they returned to her and said, \"We have done as thou hast commanded.\" The King\'s daughter took the handkerchief and once more struck thrice on the ground with it, and said, \"Earth-workers, go home again.\" Then they all went away.\n\nWhen the King\'s son awoke the fish-pond was done. Then the King\'s daughter went away also, and told him that when it was six he was to come to the house. When he arrived at the house the King asked, \"Hast thou got the fish-pond done?\" - \"Yes,\" said the King\'s son. That was very good.\n\nWhen they were again sitting at table the King said, \"Thou hast certainly done the fish-pond, but I cannot give thee my daughter yet; thou must just do one thing more.\" - \"What is that, then?\" asked the King\'s son. The King said he had a great mountain on which there was nothing but briars which must all be cut down, and at the top of it the youth must build up a great castle, which must be as strong as could be conceived, and all the furniture and fittings belonging to a castle must be inside it. And when he arose next morning the King gave him a glass axe and a glass gimlet with him, and he was to have all done by six o\'clock. As he was cutting down the first briar with the axe, it broke off short, and so small that the pieces flew all round about, and he could not use the gimlet either. Then he was quite miserable, and waited for his dearest to see if she would not come and help him in his need. When it was mid-day she came and brought him something to eat. He went to meet her and told her all, and ate something, and let her comb his hair and fell asleep. Then she once more took the knot and struck the earth with it, and said, \"Earth-workers, come forth!\" Then came once again numbers of earth-men, and asked what her desire was. Then said she, \"In the space of three hours they must cut down the whole of the briars, and a castle must be built on the top of the mountain that must be as strong as any one could conceive, and all the furniture that pertains to a castle must be inside it.\" They went away, and summoned their kindred to help them and when the time was come, all was ready. Then they came to the King\'s daughter and told her so, and the King\'s daughter took her handkerchief and struck thrice on the earth with it, and said, \"Earth-workers, go home,\" on which they all disappeared. When therefore the King\'s son awoke and saw everything done, he was as happy as a bird in air.\n\nWhen it had struck six, they went home together. Then said the King, \"Is the castle ready?\" - \"Yes,\" said the King\'s son. When they sat down to table, the King said, \"I cannot give away my youngest daughter until the two eldest are married.\" Then the King\'s son and the King\'s daughter were quite troubled, and the King\'s son had no idea what to do. But he went by night to the King\'s daughter and ran away with her. When they had got a little distance away, the King\'s daughter peeped round and saw her father behind her. \"Oh,\" said she, \"what are we to do? My father is behind us, and will take us back with him. I will at once change thee into a briar, and myself into a rose, and I will shelter myself in the midst of the bush.\" When the father reached the place, there stood a briar with one rose on it, then he was about to gather the rose, when the thorn came and pricked his finger so that he was forced to go home again. His wife asked why he had not brought their daughter back with him? So he said he had nearly got up to her, but that all at once he had lost sight of her, and a briar with one rose was growing on the spot.\n\nThen said the Queen, \"If thou hadst but gathered the rose, the briar would have been forced to come too.\" So he went back again to fetch the rose, but in the meantime the two were already far over the plain, and the King ran after them. Then the daughter once more looked round and saw her father coming, and said, \"Oh, what shall we do now? I will instantly change thee into a church and myself into a priest, and I will stand up in the pulpit, and preach.\" When the King got to the place, there stood a church, and in the pulpit was a priest preaching. So he listened to the sermon, and then went home again.\n\nThen the Queen asked why he had not brought their daughter with him, and he said, \"Nay, I ran a long time after her, and just as I thought I should soon overtake her, a church was standing there and a priest was in the pulpit preaching.\" - \"Thou shouldst just have brought the priest,\" said his wife, \"and then the church would soon have come. It is no use to send thee, I must go there myself.\" When she had walked for some time, and could see the two in the distance, the King\'s daughter peeped round and saw her mother coming, and said, \"Now we are undone, for my mother is coming herself: I will immediately change thee into a fish-pond and myself into a fish.\n\nWhen the mother came to the place, there was a large fish-pond, and in the midst of it a fish was leaping about and peeping out of the water, and it was quite merry. She wanted to catch the fish, but she could not. Then she was very angry, and drank up the whole pond in order to catch the fish, but it made her so ill that she was forced to vomit, and vomited the whole pond out again. Then she cried, \"I see very well that nothing can be done now,\" and said that now they might come back to her. Then the King\'s daughter went back again, and the Queen gave her daughter three walnuts, and said, \"With these thou canst help thyself when thou art in thy greatest need.\" So the young folks went once more away together. And when they had walked quite ten miles, they arrived at the castle from whence the King\'s son came, and close by it was a village. When they reached it, the King\'s son said, \"Stay here, my dearest, I will just go to the castle, and then will I come with a carriage and with attendants to fetch thee.\"\n\nWhen he got to the castle they all rejoiced greatly at having the King\'s son back again, and he told them he had a bride who was now in the village, and they must go with the carriage to fetch her. Then they harnessed the horses at once, and many attendants seated themselves outside the carriage. When the King\'s son was about to get in, his mother gave him a kiss, and he forgot everything which had happened, and also what he was about to do. On this his mother ordered the horses to be taken out of the carriage again, and everyone went back into the house. But the maiden sat in the village and watched and watched, and thought he would come and fetch her, but no one came. Then the King\'s daughter took service in the mill which belonged to the castle, and was obliged to sit by the pond every afternoon and clean the tubs.\n\nAnd the Queen came one day on foot from the castle, and went walking by the pond, and saw the well-grown maiden sitting there, and said, \"What a fine strong girl that is! She pleases me well!\" Then she and all with her looked at the maid, but no one knew her. So a long time passed by during which the maiden served the miller honorably and faithfully. In the meantime, the Queen had sought a wife for her son, who came from quite a distant part of the world. When the bride came, they were at once to be married. And many people hurried together, all of whom wanted to see everything. Then the girl said to the miller that he might be so good as to give her leave to go also. So the miller said, \"Yes, do go there.\" When she was about to go, she opened one of the three walnuts, and a beautiful dress lay inside it. She put it on, and went into the church and stood by the altar. Suddenly came the bride and bridegroom, and seated themselves before the altar, and when the priest was just going to bless them, the bride peeped half round and saw the maiden standing there. Then she stood up again, and said she would not be given away until she also had as beautiful a dress as that lady there. So they went back to the house again, and sent to ask the lady if she would sell that dress. No, she would not sell it, but the bride might perhaps earn it. Then the bride asked her how she was to do this? Then the maiden said if she might sleep one night outside the King\'s son\'s door, the bride might have what she wanted. So the bride said, \"Yes, she was willing to do that.\" But the servants were ordered to give the King\'s son a sleeping-drink, and then the maiden laid herself down on the threshold and lamented all night long. She had had the forest cut down for him, she had had the fish-pond cleaned out for him, she had had the castle built for him, she had changed him into a briar, and then into a church, and at last into a fish-pond, and yet he had forgotten her so quickly. The King\'s son did not hear one word of it, but the servants had been awakened, and had listened to it, and had not known what it could mean. The next morning when they were all up, the bride put on the dress, and went away to the church with the bridegroom. In the meantime the maiden opened the second walnut, and a still more beautiful dress was inside it. She put it on, and went and stood by the altar in the church, and everything happened as it had happened the time before. And the maiden again lay all night on the threshold which led to the chamber of the King\'s son, and the servant was once more to give him a sleeping-drink. The servant, however, went to him and gave him something to keep him awake, and then the King\'s son went to bed, and the miller\'s maiden bemoaned herself as before on the threshold of the door, and told of all that she had done. All this the King\'s son heard, and was sore troubled, and what was past came back to him. Then he wanted to go to her, but his mother had locked the door. The next morning, however, he went at once to his beloved, and told her everything which had happened to him, and prayed her not to be angry with him for having forgotten her. Then the King\'s daughter opened the third walnut, and within it was a still more magnificent dress, which she put on, and went with her bridegroom to church, and numbers of children came who gave them flowers, and offered them gay ribbons to bind about their feet, and they were blessed by the priest, and had a merry wedding. But the false mother and the bride had to depart. And the mouth of the person who last told all this is still warm.</string>
    <string name="story462text">Hill and vale do not come together, but the children of men do, good and bad. In this way a shoemaker and a tailor once met with each other in their travels. The tailor was a handsome little fellow who was always merry and full of enjoyment. He saw the shoemaker coming towards him from the other side, and as he observed by his bag what kind of a trade he plied, he sang a little mocking song to him,\n\n\"Sew me the seam,\nDraw me the thread,\nSpread it over with pitch,\nKnock the nail on the head.\"\nThe shoemaker, however, could not endure a joke; he pulled a face as if he had drunk vinegar, and made a gesture as if he were about to seize the tailor by the throat. But the little fellow began to laugh, reached him his bottle, and said, \"No harm was meant, take a drink, and swallow your anger down.\" The shoemaker took a very hearty drink, and the storm on his face began to clear away. He gave the bottle back to the tailor, and said, \"I spoke civilly to you; one speaks well after much drinking, but not after much thirst. Shall we travel together?\" - \"All right,\" answered the tailor, \"if only it suits you to go into a big town where there is no lack of work.\" - \"That is just where I want to go,\" answered the shoemaker. \"In a small nest there is nothing to earn, and in the country, people like to go barefoot.\" They travelled therefore onwards together, and always set one foot before the other like a weasel in the snow.\nBoth of them had time enough, but little to bite and to break. When they reached a town they went about and paid their respects to the tradesmen, and because the tailor looked so lively and merry, and had such pretty red cheeks, every one gave him work willingly, and when luck was good the master\'s daughters gave him a kiss beneath the porch, as well. When he again fell in with the shoemaker, the tailor had always the most in his bundle. The ill-tempered shoemaker made a wry face, and thought, \"The greater the rascal the more the luck,\" but the tailor began to laugh and to sing, and shared all he got with his comrade. If a couple of pence jingled in his pockets, he ordered good cheer, and thumped the table in his joy till the glasses danced, and it was lightly come, lightly go, with him.\n\nWhen they had travelled for some time, they came to a great forest through which passed the road to the capital. Two foot-paths, however, led through it, one of which was a seven days\' journey, and the other only two, but neither of the travellers knew which way was the short one. They seated themselves beneath an oak-tree, and took counsel together how they should forecast, and for how many days they should provide themselves with bread. The shoemaker said, \"One must look before one leaps, I will take with me bread for a week.\" - \"What!\" said the tailor, \"drag bread for seven days on one\'s back like a beast of burden, and not be able to look about. I shall trust in God, and not trouble myself about anything! The money I have in my pocket is as good in summer as in winter, but in hot weather bread gets dry, and mouldy into the bargain; even my coat does not go as far as it might. Besides, why should we not find the right way? Bread for two days, and that\'s enough.\" Each, therefore, bought his own bread, and then they tried their luck in the forest.\n\nIt was as quiet there as in a church. No wind stirred, no brook murmured, no bird sang, and through the thickly-leaved branches no sunbeam forced its way. The shoemaker spoke never a word, the heavy bread weighed down his back until the perspiration streamed down his cross and gloomy face. The tailor, however, was quite merry, he jumped about, whistled on a leaf, or sang a song, and thought to himself, \"God in heaven must be pleased to see me so happy.\"\n\nThis lasted two days, but on the third the forest would not come to an end, and the tailor had eaten up all his bread, so after all his heart sank down a yard deeper. In the meantime he did not lose courage, but relied on God and on his luck. On the third day he lay down in the evening hungry under a tree, and rose again next morning hungry still; so also passed the fourth day, and when the shoemaker seated himself on a fallen tree and devoured his dinner, the tailor was only a looker-on. If he begged for a little piece of bread the other laughed mockingly, and said, \"Thou hast always been so merry, now thou canst try for once what it is to be sad: the birds which sing too early in the morning are struck by the hawk in the evening,\" In short he was pitiless. But on the fifth morning the poor tailor could no longer stand up, and was hardly able to utter one word for weakness; his cheeks were white, and his eyes red. Then the shoemaker said to him, \"I will give thee a bit of bread to-day, but in return for it, I will put out thy right eye.\" The unhappy tailor who still wished to save his life, could not do it in any other way; he wept once more with both eyes, and then held them out, and the shoemaker, who had a heart of stone, put out his right eye with a sharp knife. The tailor called to remembrance what his mother had formerly said to him when he had been eating secretly in the pantry. \"Eat what one can, and suffer what one must.\" When he had consumed his dearly-bought bread, he got on his legs again, forgot his misery and comforted himself with the thought that he could always see enough with one eye. But on the sixth day, hunger made itself felt again, and gnawed him almost to the heart. In the evening he fell down by a tree, and on the seventh morning he could not raise himself up for faintness, and death was close at hand. Then said the shoemaker, \"I will show mercy and give thee bread once more, but thou shalt not have it for nothing, I shall put out thy other eye for it.\" And now the tailor felt how thoughtless his life had been, prayed to God for forgiveness, and said, \"Do what thou wilt, I will bear what I must, but remember that our Lord God does not always look on passively, and that an hour will come when the evil deed which thou hast done to me, and which I have not deserved of thee, will be requited. When times were good with me, I shared what I had with thee. My trade is of that kind that each stitch must always be exactly like the other. If I no longer have my eyes and can sew no more I must go a-begging. At any rate do not leave me here alone when I am blind, or I shall die of hunger.\" The shoemaker, however, who had driven God out of his heart, took the knife and put out his left eye. Then he gave him a bit of bread to eat, held out a stick to him, and drew him on behind him.\n\nWhen the sun went down, they got out of the forest, and before them in the open country stood the gallows. Thither the shoemaker guided the blind tailor, and then left him alone and went his way. Weariness, pain, and hunger made the wretched man fall asleep, and he slept the whole night. When day dawned he awoke, but knew not where he lay. Two poor sinners were hanging on the gallows, and a crow sat on the head of each of them. Then one of the men who had been hanged began to speak, and said, \"Brother, art thou awake?\" - \"Yes, I am awake,\" answered the second. \"Then I will tell thee something,\" said the first; \"the dew which this night has fallen down over us from the gallows, gives every one who washes himself with it his eyes again. If blind people did but know this, how many would regain their sight who do not believe that to be possible.\"\n\nWhen the tailor heard that, he took his pocket-handkerchief, pressed it on the grass, and when it was moist with dew, washed the sockets of his eyes with it. Immediately was fulfilled what the man on the gallows had said, and a couple of healthy new eyes filled the sockets. It was not long before the tailor saw the sun rise behind the mountains; in the plain before him lay the great royal city with its magnificent gates and hundred towers, and the golden balls and crosses which were on the spires began to shine. He could distinguish every leaf on the trees, saw the birds which flew past, and the midges which danced in the air. He took a needle out of his pocket, and as he could thread it as well as ever he had done, his heart danced with delight. He threw himself on his knees, thanked God for the mercy he had shown him, and said his morning prayer. He did not forget also to pray for the poor sinners who were hanging there swinging against each other in the wind like the pendulums of clocks. Then he took his bundle on his back and soon forgot the pain of heart he had endured, and went on his way singing and whistling.\n\nThe first thing he met was a brown foal running about the fields at large. He caught it by the mane, and wanted to spring on it and ride into the town. The foal, however, begged to be set free. \"I am still too young,\" it said, \"even a light tailor such as thou art would break my back in two let me go till I have grown strong. A time may perhaps come when I may reward thee for it.\" - \"Run off,\" said the tailor, \"I see thou art still a giddy thing.\" He gave it a touch with a switch over its back, whereupon it kicked up its hind legs for joy, leapt over hedges and ditches, and galloped away into the open country.\n\nBut the little tailor had eaten nothing since the day before. \"The sun to be sure fills my eyes,\" said he, \"but the bread does not fill my mouth. The first thing that comes across me and is even half edible will have to suffer for it.\" In the meantime a stork stepped solemnly over the meadow towards him. \"Halt, halt!\" cried the tailor, and seized him by the leg. \"I don\'t know if thou art good to eat or not, but my hunger leaves me no great choice. I must cut thy head off, and roast thee.\" - \"Don\'t do that,\" replied the stork; \"I am a sacred bird which brings mankind great profit, and no one does me an injury. Leave me my life, and I may do thee good in some other way.\" - \"Well, be off, Cousin Longlegs,\" said the tailor. The stork rose up, let its long legs hang down, and flew gently away.\n\n\"What\'s to be the end of this?\" said the tailor to himself at last, \"my hunger grows greater and greater, and my stomach more and more empty. Whatsoever comes in my way now is lost.\" At this moment he saw a couple of young ducks which were on a pond come swimming towards him. \"You come just at the right moment,\" said he, and laid hold of one of them and was about to wring its neck. On this an old duck which was hidden among the reeds, began to scream loudly, and swam to him with open beak, and begged him urgently to spare her dear children. \"Canst thou not imagine,\" said she, \"how thy mother would mourn if any one wanted to carry thee off, and give thee thy finishing stroke?\" - \"Only be quiet,\" said the good-tempered tailor, \"thou shalt keep thy children,\" and put the prisoner back into the water.\n\nWhen he turned round, he was standing in front of an old tree which was partly hollow, and saw some wild bees flying in and out of it. \"There I shall at once find the reward of my good deed,\" said the tailor, \"the honey will refresh me.\" But the Queen-bee came out, threatened him and said, \"If thou touchest my people, and destroyest my nest, our stings shall pierce thy skin like ten thousand red-hot needles. But if thou wilt leave us in peace and go thy way, we will do thee a service for it another time.\"\n\nThe little tailor saw that here also nothing was to be done. \"Three dishes empty and nothing on the fourth is a bad dinner!\" He dragged himself therefore with his starved-out stomach into the town, and as it was just striking twelve, all was ready-cooked for him in the inn, and he was able to sit down at once to dinner. When he was satisfied he said, \"Now I will get to work.\" He went round the town, sought a master, and soon found a good situation. As, however, he had thoroughly learnt his trade, it was not long before he became famous, and every one wanted to have his new coat made by the little tailor, whose importance increased daily. \"I can go no further in skill,\" said he, \"and yet things improve every day.\" At last the King appointed him court-tailor.\n\nBut how things do happen in the world! On the very same day his former comrade the shoemaker also became court-shoemaker. When the latter caught sight of the tailor, and saw that he had once more two healthy eyes, his conscience troubled him. \"Before he takes revenge on me,\" thought he to himself, \"I must dig a pit for him.\" He, however, who digs a pit for another, falls into it himself. In the evening when work was over and it had grown dusk, he stole to the King and said, \"Lord King, the tailor is an arrogant fellow and has boasted that he will get the gold crown back again which was lost in ancient times.\" - \"That would please me very much,\" said the King, and he caused the tailor to be brought before him next morning, and ordered him to get the crown back again, or to leave the town for ever. \"Oho!\" thought the tailor, \"a rogue gives more than he has got. If the surly King wants me to do what can be done by no one, I will not wait till morning, but will go out of the town at once, to-day.\" He packed up his bundle, therefore, but when he was without the gate he could not help being sorry to give up his good fortune, and turn his back on the town in which all had gone so well with him. He came to the pond where he had made the acquaintance of the ducks; at that very moment the old one whose young ones he had spared, was sitting there by the shore, pluming herself with her beak. She knew him again instantly, and asked why he was hanging his head so? \"Thou wilt not be surprised when thou hearest what has befallen me,\" replied the tailor, and told her his fate. \"If that be all,\" said the duck, \"we can help thee. The crown fell into the water, and lies down below at the bottom; we will soon bring it up again for thee. In the meantime just spread out thy handkerchief on the bank.\" She dived down with her twelve young ones, and in five minutes she was up again and sat with the crown resting on her wings, and the twelve young ones were swimming round about and had put their beaks under it, and were helping to carry it. They swam to the shore and put the crown on the handkerchief. No one can imagine how magnificent the crown was; when the sun shone on it, it gleamed like a hundred thousand carbuncles. The tailor tied his handkerchief together by the four corners, and carried it to the King, who was full of joy, and put a gold chain round the tailor\'s neck.\n\nWhen the shoemaker saw that one stroke had failed, he contrived a second, and went to the King and said, \"Lord King, the tailor has become insolent again; he boasts that he will copy in wax the whole of the royal palace, with everything that pertains to it, loose or fast, inside and out.\" The King sent for the tailor and ordered him to copy in wax the whole of the royal palace, with everything that pertained to it, movable or immovable, within and without, and if he did not succeed in doing this, or if so much as one nail on the wall were wanting, he should be imprisoned for his whole life under ground.\n\nThe tailor thought, \"It gets worse and worse! No one can endure that?\" and threw his bundle on his back, and went forth. When he came to the hollow tree, he sat down and hung his head. The bees came flying out, and the Queen-bee asked him if he had a stiff neck, since he held his head so awry? \"Alas, no,\" answered the tailor, \"something quite different weighs me down,\" and he told her what the King had demanded of him. The bees began to buzz and hum amongst themselves, and the Queen-bee said, \"Just go home again, but come back to-morrow at this time, and bring a large sheet with you, and then all will be well.\" So he turned back again, but the bees flew to the royal palace and straight into it through the open windows, crept round about into every corner, and inspected everything most carefully. Then they hurried back and modelled the palace in wax with such rapidity that any one looking on would have thought it was growing before his eyes. By the evening all was ready, and when the tailor came next morning, the whole of the splendid building was there, and not one nail in the wall or tile of the roof was wanting, and it was delicate withal, and white as snow, and smelt sweet as honey. The tailor wrapped it carefully in his cloth and took it to the King, who could not admire it enough, placed it in his largest hall, and in return for it presented the tailor with a large stone house.\n\nThe shoemaker, however, did not give up, but went for the third time to the King and said, \"Lord King, it has come to the tailor\'s ears that no water will spring up in the court-yard of the castle, and he has boasted that it shall rise up in the midst of the court-yard to a man\'s height and be clear as crystal.\" Then the King ordered the tailor to be brought before him and said, \"If a stream of water does not rise in my court-yard by to-morrow as thou hast promised, the executioner shall in that very place make thee shorter by the head.\" The poor tailor did not take long to think about it, but hurried out to the gate, and because this time it was a matter of life and death to him, tears rolled down his face. Whilst he was thus going forth full of sorrow, the foal to which he had formerly given its liberty, and which had now become a beautiful chestnut horse, came leaping towards him. \"The time has come,\" it said to the tailor, \"when I can repay thee for thy good deed. I know already what is needful to thee, but thou shalt soon have help; get on me, my back can carry two such as thou.\" The tailor\'s courage came back to him; he jumped up in one bound, and the horse went full speed into the town, and right up to the court-yard of the castle. It galloped as quick as lightning thrice round it, and at the third time it fell violently down. At the same instant, however, there was a terrific clap of thunder, a fragment of earth in the middle of the court-yard sprang like a cannon-ball into the air, and over the castle, and directly after it a jet of water rose as high as a man on horseback, and the water was as pure as crystal, and the sunbeams began to dance on it. When the King saw that he arose in amazement, and went and embraced the tailor in the sight of all men.\n\nBut good fortune did not last long. The King had daughters in plenty, one still prettier than the other, but he had no son. So the malicious shoemaker betook himself for the fourth time to the King, and said, \"Lord King, the tailor has not given up his arrogance. He has now boasted that if he liked, he could cause a son to be brought to the Lord king through the air.\" The King commanded the tailor to be summoned, and said, \"If thou causest a son to be brought to me within nine days, thou shalt have my eldest daughter to wife.\" - \"The reward is indeed great,\" thought the little tailor; \"one would willingly do something for it, but the cherries grow too high for me, if I climb for them, the bough will break beneath me, and I shall fall.\"\n\nHe went home, seated himself cross-legged on his work-table, and thought over what was to be done. \"It can\'t be managed,\" cried he at last, \"I will go away; after all I can\'t live in peace here.\" He tied up his bundle and hurried away to the gate. When he got to the meadow, he perceived his old friend the stork, who was walking backwards and forwards like a philosopher. Sometimes he stood still, took a frog into close consideration, and at length swallowed it down. The stork came to him and greeted him. \"I see,\" he began, \"that thou hast thy pack on thy back. Why art thou leaving the town?\" The tailor told him what the King had required of him, and how he could not perform it, and lamented his misfortune. \"Don\'t let thy hair grow grey about that,\" said the stork, \"I will help thee out of thy difficulty. For a long time now, I have carried the children in swaddling-clothes into the town, so for once in a way I can fetch a little prince out of the well. Go home and be easy. In nine days from this time repair to the royal palace, and there will I come.\" The little tailor went home, and at the appointed time was at the castle. It was not long before the stork came flying thither and tapped at the window. The tailor opened it, and cousin Longlegs came carefully in, and walked with solemn steps over the smooth marble pavement. He had, moreover, a baby in his beak that was as lovely as an angel, and stretched out its little hands to the Queen. The stork laid it in her lap, and she caressed it and kissed it, and was beside herself with delight. Before the stork flew away, he took his travelling bag off his back and handed it over to the Queen. In it there were little paper parcels with colored sweetmeats, and they were divided amongst the little princesses. The eldest, however, had none of them, but got the merry tailor for a husband. \"It seems to me,\" said he, \"just as if I had won the highest prize. My mother was if right after all, she always said that whoever trusts in God and only has good luck, can never fail.\"\n\nThe shoemaker had to make the shoes in which the little tailor danced at the wedding festival, after which he was commanded to quit the town for ever. The road to the forest led him to the gallows. Worn out with anger, rage, and the heat of the day, he threw himself down. When he had closed his eyes and was about to sleep, the two crows flew down from the heads of the men who were hanging there, and pecked his eyes out. In his madness he ran into the forest and must have died there of hunger, for no one has ever either seen him again or heard of him.</string>
    <string name="story463text">A man and his wife were once sitting by the door of their house, and they had a roasted chicken set before them, and were about to eat it together. Then the man saw that his aged father was coming, and hastily took the chicken and hid it, for he would not permit him to have any of it. The old man came, took a drink, and went away. Now the son wanted to put the roasted chicken on the table again, but when he took it up, it had become a great toad, which jumped into his face and sat there and never went away again, and if any one wanted to take it off, it looked venomously at him as if it would jump in his face, so that no one would venture to touch it. And the ungrateful son was forced to feed the toad every day, or else it fed itself on his face; and thus he went about the world without knowing rest.</string>
    <string name="story464text">One summer morning a little tailor was sitting on his board near the window, and working cheerfully with all his might, when an old woman came down the street crying, \"Good jelly to sell! good jelly to sell!\" The cry sounded pleasant in the little tailor\'s ears, so he put his head out of the window, and called out, \"Here, my good woman, come here, if you want a customer.\"\n\nSo the poor woman climbed the steps with her heavy basket, and was obliged to unpack and display all her pots to the tailor. He looked at every one of them, and lifting all the lids, applied his nose to each, and said at last, \"The jelly seems pretty good; you may weigh me out four half ounces, or I don\'t mind having a quarter of a pound.\" The woman, who had expected to find a good customer, gave him what he asked for, but went off angry and grumbling. \"This jelly is the very thing for me,\" cried the little tailor; \"it will give me strength and cunning; \"and he took down the bread from the cupboard, cut a whole round of the loaf, and spread the jelly on it, laid it near him, and went on stitching more gallantly than ever.\n\nAll the while the scent of the sweet jelly was spreading throughout the room, where there were quantities of flies, who were attracted by it and flew to partake. \"Now then, who asked you to come?\" said the tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. But the flies, not understanding his language, were not to be got rid of like that, and returned in larger numbers than before. Then the tailor, not being able to stand it any longer, took from his chimney-corner a ragged cloth, and saying, \"Now, I\'ll let you have it!\" beat it among them unmercifully. When he ceased, and counted the slain, he found seven lying dead before him. \"This is indeed somewhat,\" he said, wondering at his own gallantry; \"the whole town shall know this.\" So he hastened to cut out a belt, and he stitched it^ and put on it in large capitals \"Seven at one blow!\"\n\n\"The town, did I say!\" said the little tailor; \"the whole world shall know it!\" And his heart quivered with joy, like a lamb\'s tail. The tailor fastened the belt round him, and began to think of going out into the world, for his workshop seemed too small for his worship. So he looked about in all the house for something that it would be useful to take with him, but he found nothing but an old cheese, which he put in his pocket. Outside the door he noticed that a bird had got caught in the bushes, so he took that and put it in his pocket with the cheese. Then he set out gallantly on his way, and as he was light and active he felt no fatigue.\n\nThe way led over a mountain, and when he reached the topmost peak he saw a terrible giant sitting there, and looking about him at his ease. The tailor went bravely up to him, called out to him, and said, \"Comrade, good day! there you sit looking over the wide world! I am on the way thither to seek my fortune: have you a fancy to go with me?\"\n\nThe giant looked at the tailor contemptuously, and said, \"You little rascal! you miserable fellow!\" - \"That may be!\" answered the little tailor, and undoing his coat he showed the giant his belt; \"you can read there whether I am a man or not!\" The giant read: \"Seven at one blow!\" and thinking it meant men that the tailor had killed, felt at once more respect for the little fellow. But as he wanted to prove him, he took up a stone and squeezed it so hard that water came out of it. \"Now you can do that,\" said the giant, \"that is, if you have the strength for it.\"\n\n\"That\'s not much,\" said the little tailor, \"I call that play,\" and he put his hand in his pocket and took out the cheese and squeezed it, so that the whey ran out of it. \"Well,\" said he, \"what do you think of that?\"\n\nThe giant did not know what to say to it, for he could not have believed it of the little man. Then the giant took up a stone and threw it so high that it was nearly out of sight. \"Now, little fellow, suppose you do that!\"\n\n\"Well thrown,\" said the tailor; \"but the stone fell back to earth again, I will throw you one that will never come back.\" So he felt in his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air. And the bird, when it found itself at liberty, took wing, flew off, and returned no more. \"What do you think of that, comrade?\" asked the tailor. \"There is no doubt that you can throw,\" said the giant; \"but we will see if you can carry.\" He led the little tailor to a mighty oak-tree which had been felled, and was lying on the ground, and said, \"Now, if you are strong enough, help me to carry this tree out of the wood.\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" answered the little man; \"you take the trunk on your shoulders, I will take the branches with all their foliage, that is much the most difficult.\" So the giant took the trunk on his shoulders, and the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who could not see what he was doing, had the whole tree to carry, and the little man on it as well. And the little man was very cheerful and merry, and whistled the tune: \"There were three tailors riding by\" as if carrying the tree was mere child\'s play. The giant, when he had struggled on under his heavy load a part of the way, was tired out, and cried, \"Look here, I must let go the tree!\"\n\nThe tailor jumped off quickly, and taking hold of the tree with both arms, as if he were carrying it, said to the giant, \"You see you can\'t carry the tree though you are such a big fellow!\"\n\nThey went on together a little farther, and presently they came to a cherry-tree, and the giant took hold of the topmost branches, where the ripest fruit hung, and pulling them downwards, gave them to the tailor to hold, bidding him eat. But the little tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and as the giant let go, the tree sprang back, and the tailor was caught up into the air. And when he dropped down again without any damage, the giant said to him, \"How is this? haven\'t you strength enough to hold such a weak sprig as that?\"\n\n\"It is not strength that is lacking,\" answered the little tailor; \"how should it to one who has slain seven at one blow! I just jumped over the tree because the hunters are shooting down there in the bushes. You jump it too, if you can.\" The giant made the attempt, and not being able to vault the tree, he remained hanging in the branches, so that once more the little tailor got the better of him.\n\nThen said the giant, \"As you are such a gallant fellow, suppose you come with me to our den, and stay the night.\" The tailor was quite willing, and he followed him. When they reached the den there sat some other giants by the fire, and each had a roasted sheep in his hand, and was eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought, \"There is more elbow-room here than in my workshop.\" And the giant showed him a bed, and told him he had better lie down upon it and go to sleep. The bed was, however, too big for the tailor, so he did not stay in it, but crept into a corner to sleep.\n\nAs soon as it was midnight the giant got up, took a great staff of iron and beat the bed through with one stroke, and supposed he had made an end of that grasshopper of a tailor.\n\nVery early in the morning the giants went into the wood and forgot all about the little tailor, and when they saw him coming after them alive and merry, they were terribly frightened, and, thinking he was going to kill them, they ran away in all haste.\n\nSo the little tailor marched on, always following his nose. And after he had gone a great way he entered the courtyard belonging to a King\'s palace, and there he felt so overpowered with fatigue that he lay down and fell asleep. In the meanwhile came various people, who looked at him very curiously, and read on his belt, \"Seven at one blow!\" - \"Oh!\" said they, \"why should this great lord come here in time of peace? what a mighty champion he must be.\" Then they went and told the King about him, and they thought that if war should break out what a worthy and useful man he would be, and that he ought not to be allowed to depart at any price.\n\nThe King then summoned his council, and sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to beg him, so soon as he should wake up, to consent to serve in the King\'s army. So the messenger stood and waited at the sleeper\'s side until his limbs began to stretch, and his eyes to open, and then he carried his answer back. And the answer was, \"That was the reason for which I came,\" said the little tailor, \"I am ready to enter the King\'s service.\" So he was received into it very honourably, and a separate dwelling set apart for him. But the rest of the soldiers were very much set against the little tailor, and they wished him a thousand miles away. \"What shall be done about it?\" they said among themselves; \"if we pick a quarrel and fight with him then seven of us will fall at each blow. That will be of no good to us.\" So they came to a resolution, and went all together to the King to ask for their discharge. \"We never intended,\" said they, \"to serve with a man who kills seven at a blow.\" The King felt sorry to lose all his faithful servants because of one man, and he wished that he had never seen him, and would willingly get rid of him if he might. But he did not dare to dismiss the little tailor for fear he should kill all the King\'s people, and place himself upon the throne.\n\nHe thought a long while about it, and at last made up his mind what to do. He sent for the little tailor, and told him that as he was so great a warrior he had a proposal to make to him. He told him that in a wood in his dominions dwelt two giants, who did great damage by robbery, murder, and fire, and that no man durst go near them for fear of his life. But that if the tailor should overcome and slay both these giants the King would give him his only daughter in marriage, and half his kingdom as dowry, and that a hundred horsemen should go with him to give him assistance. \"That would be something for a man like me 1\"thought the little tailor, \"a beautiful princess and half a kingdom are not to be had every day.\"\n\nAnd he said to the King, \"Oh yes, I can soon overcome the giants, and yet have no need of the hundred horsemen; he who can kill seven at one blow has no need to be afraid of two.\"\n\nSo the little tailor set out, and the hundred horsemen followed him. When he came to the border of the wood he said to his escort, \"Stay here while I go to attack the giants.\" Then he sprang into the wood, and looked about him right and left. After a while he caught sight of the two giants; they were lying down under a tree asleep, and snoring so that all the branches shook. The little tailor, all alive, filled both his pockets with stones and climbed up into the tree, and made his way to an overhanging bough, so that he could seat himself just above the sleepers; and from there he let one stone after another fall on the chest of one of the giants. For a long time the giant was quite unaware of this, but at last he waked up and pushed his comrade, and said, \"What are you hitting me for?\"\n\n\"You are dreaming,\" said the other, \"I am not touching you.\" And they composed themselves again to sleep, and the tailor let fall a stone on the other giant. \"What can that be?\" cried he, \"what are you casting at me?\"\n\n\"I am casting nothing at you,\" answered the first, grumbling. They disputed about it for a while, but as they were tired, they gave it up at last, and their eyes closed once more. Then the little tailor began his game anew, picked out a heavier stone and threw it down with force upon the first giant\'s chest. \"This is too much!\" cried he, and sprang up like a madman and struck his companion such a blow that the tree shook above them. The other paid him back with ready coin, and they fought with such fury that they tore up trees by their roots to use for weapons against each other, so that at last they both of them lay dead upon the ground. And now the little tailor got down. \"Another piece of luck!\" said he, \"that the tree I was sitting in did not get torn up too, or else I should have had to jump like a squirrel from one tree to another.\" Then he drew his sword and gave each of the giants a few hacks in the breast, and went back to the horsemen and said, \"The deed is done, I have made an end of both of them: but it went hard with me, in the struggle they rooted up trees to defend themselves, but it was of no use, they had to do with a man who can kill seven at one blow.\"\n\n\"Then are you not wounded?\" asked the horsemen. \"Nothing of the sort!\" answered the tailor, \"I have not turned a hair.\" The horsemen still would not believe it, and rode into the wood to see, and there they found the giants wallowing in their blood, and all about them lying the uprooted trees. The little tailor then claimed the promised boon, but the King repented him of his offer, and he sought again how to rid himself of the hero. \"Before you can possess my daughter and the half of my kingdom,\" said he to the tailor, \"you must perform another heroic act. In the wood lives a unicorn who does great damage; you must secure him.\"\n\n\"A unicorn does not strike more terror into me than two giants. Seven at one blow! - that is my way,\" was the tailor\'s answer. So, taking a rope and an axe with him, he went out into the wood, and told those who were ordered to attend him to wait outside.\n\nHe had not far to seek, the unicorn soon came out and sprang at him, as if he would make an end of him without delay. \"Softly, softly,\" said he, \"most haste, worst speed,\" and remained standing until the animal came quite near, then he slipped quietly behind a tree. The unicorn ran with all his might against the tree and stuck his horn so deep into the trunk that he could not get it out again, and so was taken. \"Now I have you,\" said the tailor, coming out from behind the tree, and, putting the rope round the unicorn\'s neck, he took the axe, set free the horn, and when all his party were assembled he led forth the animal and brought it to the King.\n\nThe King did not yet wish to give him the promised reward, and set him a third task to do. Before the wedding could take place the tailor was to secure a wild boar which had done a great deal of damage in the wood. The huntsmen were to accompany him. \"All right,\" said the tailor, \"this is child\'s play.\" But he did not take the huntsmen into the wood, and they were all the better pleased, for the wild boar had many a time before received them in such a way that they had no fancy to disturb him.\n\nWhen the boar caught sight of the tailor he ran at him with foaming mouth and gleaming tusks to bear him to the ground, but the nimble hero rushed into a chapel which chanced to be near, and jumped quickly out of a window on the other side. The boar ran after him, and when he got inside the door shut after him, and there he was imprisoned, for the creature was too big and unwieldy to jump out of the window too. Then the little tailor called the huntsmen that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes; and then he betook himself to the king, who now, whether he liked it or not, was obliged to fulfil his promise, and give him his daughter and the half of his kingdom. But if he had known that the great warrior was only a little tailor he would have taken it still more to heart. So the wedding was celebrated with great splendour and little joy, and the tailor was made into a king.\n\nOne night the young queen heard her husband talking in his sleep and saying, \"Now boy, make me that waistcoat and patch me those breeches, or I will lay my yard measure about your shoulders!\" And so, as she perceived of what low birth her husband was, she went to her father the next morning and told him all, and begged him to set her free from a man who was nothing better than a tailor. The king bade her be comforted, saying, \"To-night leave your bedroom door open, my guard shall stand outside, and when he is asleep they shall come in and bind him and carry him off to a ship, and he shall be sent to the other side of the world.\" So the wife felt consoled, but the king\'s water-bearer, who had been listening all the while, went to the little tailor and disclosed to him the whole plan. \"I shall put a stop to all this,\" said he.\n\nAt night he lay down as usual in bed, and when his wife thought that he was asleep, she got up, opened the door and lay down again. The little tailor, who only made believe to be asleep, began to murmur plainly, \"Now, boy, make me that waistcoat and patch me those breeches, or I will lay my yard measure about your shoulders! I have slain seven at one blow, killed two giants, caught a unicorn, and taken a wild boar, and shall I be afraid of those who are standing outside my room door?\" And when they heard the tailor say this, a great fear seized them; they fled away as if they had been wild hares, and none of them would venture to attack him. And so the little tailor all his lifetime remained a king.</string>
    <string name="story465text">There was once a King who had an illness, and no one believed that he would come out of it with his life. He had three sons who were much distressed about it, and went down into the palace-garden and wept. There they met an old man who inquired as to the cause of their grief. They told him that their father was so ill that he would most certainly die, for nothing seemed to cure him. Then the old man said, \"I know of one more remedy, and that is the water of life; if he drinks of it he will become well again; but it is hard to find.\" The eldest said, \"I will manage to find it,\" and went to the sick King, and begged to be allowed to go forth in search of the water of life, for that alone could save him. \"No,\" said the King, \"the danger of it is too great. I would rather die.\" But he begged so long that the King consented. The prince thought in his heart, \"If I bring the water, then I shall be best beloved of my father, and shall inherit the kingdom.\" So he set out, and when he had ridden forth a little distance, a dwarf stood there in the road who called to him and said, \"Whither away so fast?\" - \"Silly shrimp,\" said the prince, very haughtily, \"it is nothing to do with you,\" and rode on. But the little dwarf had grown angry, and had wished an evil wish. Soon after this the prince entered a ravine, and the further he rode the closer the mountains drew together, and at last the road became so narrow that he could not advance a step further; it was impossible either to turn his horse or to dismount from the saddle, and he was shut in there as if in prison. The sick King waited long for him, but he came not. Then the second son said, \"Father, let me go forth to seek the water,\" and thought to himself, \"If my brother is dead, then the kingdom will fall to me.\" At first the King would not allow him to go either, but at last he yielded, so the prince set out on the same road that his brother had taken, and he too met the dwarf, who stopped him to ask, whither he was going in such haste? \"Little shrimp,\" said the prince, \"that is nothing to thee,\" and rode on without giving him another look. But the dwarf bewitched him, and he, like the other, rode into a ravine, and could neither go forwards nor backwards. So fare haughty people.\nAs the second son also remained away, the youngest begged to be allowed to go forth to fetch the water, and at last the King was obliged to let him go. When he met the dwarf and the latter asked him whither he was going in such haste, he stopped, gave him an explanation, and said, \"I am seeking the water of life, for my father is sick unto death.\" - \"Dost thou know, then, where that is to be found?\" - \"No,\" said the prince. \"As thou hast borne thyself as is seemly, and not haughtily like thy false brothers, I will give thee the information and tell thee how thou mayst obtain the water of life. It springs from a fountain in the courtyard of an enchanted castle, but thou wilt not be able to make thy way to it, if I do not give thee an iron wand and two small loaves of bread. Strike thrice with the wand on the iron door of the castle and it will spring open: inside lie two lions with gaping jaws, but if thou throwest a loaf to each of them, they will be quieted. Then hasten to fetch some of the water of life before the clock strikes twelve, else the door will shut again, and thou wilt be imprisoned.\" The prince thanked him, took the wand and the bread, and set out on his way. When he arrived, everything was as the dwarf had said. The door sprang open at the third stroke of the wand, and when he had appeased the lions with the bread, he entered the castle, and came to a large and splendid hall, wherein sat some enchanted princes whose rings he drew off their fingers. A sword and a loaf of bread were lying there, which he carried away. After this, he entered a chamber, in which was a beautiful maiden who rejoiced when she saw him, kissed him, and told him that he had delivered her, and should have the whole of her kingdom, and that if he would return in a year their wedding should be celebrated; likewise she told him where the spring of the water of life was, and that he was to hasten and draw some of it before the clock struck twelve. Then he went onwards, and at last entered a room where there was a beautiful newly-made bed, and as he was very weary, he felt inclined to rest a little. So he lay down and fell asleep. When he awoke, it was striking a quarter to twelve. He sprang up in a fright, ran to the spring, drew some water in a cup which stood near, and hastened away. But just as he was passing through the iron door, the clock struck twelve, and the door fell to with such violence that it carried away a piece of his heel. He, however, rejoicing at having obtained the water of life, went homewards, and again passed the dwarf. When the latter saw the sword and the loaf, he said, \"With these thou hast won great wealth; with the sword thou canst slay whole armies, and the bread will never come to an end.\" But the prince would not go home to his father without his brothers, and said, \"Dear dwarf, canst thou not tell me where my two brothers are? They went out before I did in search of the water of life, and have not returned.\" - \"They are imprisoned between two mountains,\" said the dwarf. \"I have condemned them to stay there, because they were so haughty.\" Then the prince begged until the dwarf released them; but he warned him, however, and said, \"Beware of them, for they have bad hearts.\" When his brothers came, he rejoiced, and told them how things had gone with him, that he had found the water of life and had brought a cupful away with him, and had rescued a beautiful princess, who was willing to wait a year for him, and then their wedding was to be celebrated and he would obtain a great kingdom. After that they rode on together, and chanced upon a land where war and famine reigned, and the King already thought he must perish, for the scarcity was so great. Then the prince went to him and gave him the loaf, wherewith he fed and satisfied the whole of his kingdom, and then the prince gave him the sword also wherewith he slew the hosts of his enemies, and could now live in rest and peace. The prince then took back his loaf and his sword, and the three brothers rode on. But after this they entered two more countries where war and famine reigned and each time the prince gave his loaf and his sword to the Kings, and had now delivered three kingdoms, and after that they went on board a ship and sailed over the sea. During the passage, the two eldest conversed apart and said, \"The youngest has found the water of life and not we, for that our father will give him the kingdom the kingdom which belongs to us, and he will rob us of all our fortune.\" They then began to seek revenge, and plotted with each other to destroy him. They waited until they found him fast asleep, then they poured the water of life out of the cup, and took it for themselves, but into the cup they poured salt sea-water. Now therefore, when they arrived home, the youngest took his cup to the sick King in order that he might drink out of it, and be cured. But scarcely had he drunk a very little of the salt sea-water than he became still worse than before. And as he was lamenting over this, the two eldest brothers came, and accused the youngest of having intended to poison him, and said that they had brought him the true water of life, and handed it to him. He had scarcely tasted it, when he felt his sickness departing, and became strong and healthy as in the days of his youth. After that they both went to the youngest, mocked him, and said, \"You certainly found the water of life, but you have had the pain, and we the gain; you should have been sharper, and should have kept your eyes open. We took it from you whilst you were asleep at sea, and when a year is over, one of us will go and fetch the beautiful princess. But beware that you do not disclose aught of this to our father; indeed he does not trust you, and if you say a single word, you shall lose your life into the bargain, but if you keep silent, you shall have it as a gift.\"\n\nThe old King was angry with his youngest son, and thought he had plotted against his life. So he summoned the court together and had sentence pronounced upon his son, that he should be secretly shot. And once when the prince was riding forth to the chase, suspecting no evil, the King\'s huntsman had to go with him, and when they were quite alone in the forest, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that the prince said to him, \"Dear huntsman, what ails you?\" The huntsman said, \"I cannot tell you, and yet I ought.\" Then the prince said, \"Say openly what it is, I will pardon you.\" - \"Alas!\" said the huntsman, \"I am to shoot you dead, the King has ordered me to do it.\" Then the prince was shocked, and said, \"Dear huntsman, let me live; there, I give you my royal garments; give me your common ones in their stead.\" The huntsman said, \"I will willingly do that, indeed I should not have been able to shoot you.\" Then they exchanged clothes, and the huntsman returned home; the prince, however, went further into the forest. After a time three waggons of gold and precious stones came to the King for his youngest son, which were sent by the three Kings who had slain their enemies with the prince\'s sword, and maintained their people with his bread, and who wished to show their gratitude for it. The old King then thought, \"Can my son have been innocent?\" and said to his people, \"Would that he were still alive, how it grieves me that I have suffered him to be killed!\" - \"He still lives,\" said the huntsman, \"I could not find it in my heart to carry out your command,\" and told the King how it had happened. Then a stone fell from the King\'s heart, and he had it proclaimed in every country that his son might return and be taken into favour again.\n\nThe princess, however, had a road made up to her palace which was quite bright and golden, and told her people that whosoever came riding straight along it to her, would be the right wooer and was to be admitted, and whoever rode by the side of it, was not the right one, and was not to be admitted. As the time was now close at hand, the eldest thought he would hasten to go to the King\'s daughter, and give himself out as her deliverer, and thus win her for his bride, and the kingdom to boot. Therefore he rode forth, and when he arrived in front of the palace, and saw the splendid golden road, he thought, it would be a sin and a shame if he were to ride over that, and turned aside, and rode on the right side of it. But when he came to the door, the servants told him that he was not the right man, and was to go away again. Soon after this the second prince set out, and when he came to the golden road, and his horse had put one foot on it, he thought, it would be a sin and a shame to tread a piece of it off, and he turned aside and rode on the left side of it, and when he reached the door, the attendants told him he was not the right one, and he was to go away again. When at last the year had entirely expired, the third son likewise wished to ride out of the forest to his beloved, and with her forget his sorrows. So he set out and thought of her so incessantly, and wished to be with her so much, that he never noticed the golden road at all. So his horse rode onwards up the middle of it, and when he came to the door, it was opened and the princess received him with joy, and said he was her deliverer, and lord of the kingdom, and their wedding was celebrated with great rejoicing. When it was over she told him that his father invited him to come to him, and had forgiven him. So he rode thither, and told him everything; how his brothers had betrayed him, and how he had nevertheless kept silence. The old King wished to punish them, but they had put to sea, and never came back as long as they lived.</string>
    <string name="story466text">A little brother and sister were once playing by a well, and while they were thus playing, they both fell in. A water-nix lived down below, who said, \"Now I have got you, now you shall work hard for me!\" and carried them off with her. She gave the girl dirty tangled flax to spin, and she had to fetch water in a bucket with a hole in it, and the boy had to hew down a tree with a blunt axe, and they got nothing to eat but dumplings as hard as stones. Then at last the children became so impatient, that they waited until one Sunday, when the nix was at church, and ran away. But when church was over, the nix saw that the birds were flown, and followed them with great strides. The children saw her from afar, and the girl threw a brush behind her which formed an immense hill of bristles, with thousands and thousands of spikes, over which the nix was forced to scramble with great difficulty; at last, however, she got over. When the children saw this, the boy threw behind him a comb which made a great hill of combs with a thousand times a thousand teeth, but the nix managed to keep herself steady on them, and at last crossed over that. Then the girl threw behind her a looking-glass which formed a hill of mirrors, and was so slippery that it was impossible for the nix to cross it. Then she thought, \"I will go home quickly and fetch my axe, and cut the hill of glass in half.\" Long before she returned, however, and had hewn through the glass, the children had escaped to a great distance, and the water-nix was obliged to betake herself to her well again.</string>
    <string name="story467text">FIRST STORY\n\nThere was once on a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to try her. He stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved as if he were stone dead. Mrs. Fox went up to her room, shut herself in, and her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it became known that the old fox was dead, wooers presented themselves. The maid heard some one standing at the house-door, knocking. She went and opened it, and it was a young fox, who said,\n\n\"What may you be about, Miss Cat.?\nDo you sleep or do you wake?\"\nShe answered,\n\"I am not sleeping, I am waking,\nWouldst thou know what I am making?\nI am boiling warm beer with butter so nice,\nWill the gentleman enter and drink some likewise?\"\n\"No, thank you, miss,\" said the fox, \"what is Mrs. Fox doing?\" The maid replied,\n\"She sits all alone,\nAnd makes her moan,\nWeeping her little eyes quite red,\nBecause old Mr. Fox is dead.\"\n\"Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo her.\" - \"Certainly, young sir.\"\nThe cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,\nThe door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,\n\"Mistress Fox, are you inside?\"\n\"Oh yes, my little cat,\" she cried.\n\"A wooer he stands at the door out there.\"\n\"Tell me what he is like, my dear?\"\n\"But has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr. Fox?\" - \"Oh, no,\" answered the cat, \"he has only one.\"\n\"Then I will not have him.\" Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs. Fox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After this still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they were all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like old Mr. Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat,\n\n\"Now open the gates and doors all wide,\nAnd carry old Mr. Fox outside.\"\nBut just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr. Fox stirred under the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs. Fox out of the house.\n\nSECOND STORY\n\nWhen old Mr. Fox was dead, the wolf came as a wooer, and knocked at the door, and the cat who was servant to Mrs. Fox, opened it for him. The wolf greeted her, and said,\n\n\"Good day, Mrs. Cat of Kehrewit,\n\"How comes it that alone you sit?\nWhat are you making good?\"\nThe cat replied,\n\"In milk I\'m breaking bread so sweet,\nWill the gentleman please come in and eat?\"\n\"No, thank you, Mrs. Cat,\" answered the wolf. \"Is Mrs. Fox not at home?\"\nThe cat said,\n\n\"She sits upstairs in her room,\nBewailing her sorrowful doom,\nBewailing her trouble so sore,\nFor old Mr. Fox is no more.\"\nThe wolf answered,\n\"If she\'s in want of a husband now,\nThen will it please her to step below?\"\nThe cat runs quickly up the stair,\nAnd lets her tail fly here and there,\nUntil she comes to the parlour door.\nWith her five gold rings at the door she knocks,\n\"Are you within, good Mistress Fox?\nIf you\'re in want of a husband now,\nThen will it please you to step below?\nMrs. Fox asked, \"Has the gentleman red stockings on\' and has he a pointed mouth?\" - \"No,\" answered the cat. \"Then he won\'t do for me.\"\nWhen the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and all the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the good points which old Mr. Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the cat had continually to send the wooers away. At length came a young fox. Then Mrs. Fox said, \"Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a little pointed mouth?\" - \"Yes,\" said the cat, \"he has.\" - \"Then let him come upstairs,\" said Mrs. Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding-feast.\n\n\"Sweep me the room as clean as you can,\nUp with the window, fling out my old man!\nFor many a fine fat mouse he brought,\nYet of his wife he never thought,\nBut ate up every one he caught.\"\nThen the wedding was solemnized with young Mr. Fox, and there was much rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing still.</string>
    <string name="story468text">A woman was going about the unenclosed land with her daughter and her step-daughter cutting fodder, when the Lord came walking towards them in the form of a poor man, and asked, \"Which is the way into the village?\" - \"If you want to know,\" said the mother, \"seek it for yourself,\" and the daughter added, \"If you are afraid you will not find it, take a guide with you.\" But the step-daughter said, \"Poor man, I will take you there, come with me.\" Then God was angry with the mother and daughter, and turned his back on them, and wished that they should become as black as night and as ugly as sin. To the poor step-daughter, however, God was gracious, and went with her, and when they were near the village, he said a blessing over her, and spake, \"Choose three things for thyself, and I will grant them to thee.\" Then said the maiden, \"I should like to be as beautiful and fair as the sun,\" and instantly she was white and fair as day. \"Then I should like to have a purse of money which would never grow empty.\" That the Lord gave her also, but he said, \"Do not forget what is best of all.\" Said she, \"For my third wish, I desire, after my death, to inhabit the eternal kingdom of Heaven.\" That also was granted unto her, and then the Lord left her. When the step-mother came home with her daughter, and they saw that they were both as black as coal and ugly, but that the step-daughter was white and beautiful, wickedness increased still more in their hearts, and they thought of nothing else but how they could do her an injury. The step-daughter, however, had a brother called Reginer, whom she loved much, and she told him all that had happened. Once on a time Reginer said to her, \"Dear sister, I will take thy likeness, that I may continually see thee before mine eyes, for my love for thee is so great that I should like always to look at thee.\" Then she answered, \"But, I pray thee, let no one see the picture.\" So he painted his sister and hung up the picture in his room; he, however, dwelt in the King\'s palace, for he was his coachman. Every day he went and stood before the picture, and thanked God for the happiness of having such a dear sister. Now it happened that the King whom he served, had just lost his wife, who had been so beautiful that no one could be found to compare with her, and on this account the King was in deep grief. The attendants about the court, however, remarked that the coachman stood daily before this beautiful picture, and they were jealous of him, so they informed the King. Then the latter ordered the picture to be brought to him, and when he saw that it was like his lost wife in every respect, except that it was still more beautiful, he fell mortally in love with it. He caused the coachman to be brought before him, and asked whom the portrait represented? The coachman said it was his sister, so the King resolved to take no one but her as his wife, and gave him a carriage and horses and splendid garments of cloth of gold, and sent him forth to fetch his chosen bride. When Reginer came on this errand, his sister was glad, but the black maiden was jealous of her good fortune, and grew angry above all measure, and said to her mother, \"Of what use are all your arts to us now when you cannot procure such a piece of luck for me?\" - \"Be quiet,\" said the old woman, \"I will soon divert it to you,\" and by her arts of witchcraft, she so troubled the eyes of the coachman that he was half-blind, and she stopped the ears of the white maiden so that she was half-deaf. Then they got into the carriage, first the bride in her noble royal apparel, then the step-mother with her daughter, and Reginer sat on the box to drive. When they had been on the way for some time the coachman cried,\n\n\"Cover thee well, my sister dear,\nThat the rain may not wet thee,\nThat the wind may not load thee with dust,\nThat thou may\'st be fair and beautiful\nWhen thou appearest before the King.\"\nThe bride asked, \"What is my dear brother saying?\" - \"Ah,\" said the old woman, \"he says that you ought to take off your golden dress and give it to your sister.\" Then she took it off, and put it on the black maiden, who gave her in exchange for it a shabby grey gown. They drove onwards, and a short time afterwards, the brother again cried,\n\n\"Cover thee well, my sister dear,\nThat the rain may not wet thee,\nThat the wind may not load thee with dust,\nThat thou may\'st be fair and beautiful\nWhen thou appearest before the King.\"\nThe bride asked, \"What is my dear brother saying?\" - \"Ah,\" said the old woman, \"he says that you ought to take off your golden hood and give it to your sister.\" So she took off the hood and put it on her sister, and sat with her own head uncovered. And they drove on farther. After a while, the brother once more cried,\n\n\n\"Cover thee well, my sister dear,\nThat the rain may not wet thee,\nThat the wind may not load thee with dust,\nThat thou may\'st be fair and beautiful\nWhen thou appearest before the King.\"\nThe bride asked, \"What is my dear brother saying?\" - \"Ah,\" said the old woman, \"he says you must look out of the carriage.\" They were, however, just on a bridge, which crossed deep water. When the bride stood up and leant forward out of the carriage, they both pushed her out, and she fell into the middle of the water. At the same moment that she sank, a snow-white duck arose out of the mirror-smooth water, and swam down the river. The brother had observed nothing of it, and drove the carriage on until they reached the court. Then he took the black maiden to the King as his sister, and thought she really was so, because his eyes were dim, and he saw the golden garments glittering. When the King saw the boundless ugliness of his intended bride, he was very angry, and ordered the coachman to be thrown into a pit which was full of adders and nests of snakes. The old witch, however, knew so well how to flatter the King and deceive his eyes by her arts, that he kept her and her daughter until she appeared quite endurable to him, and he really married her.\n\nOne evening when the black bride was sitting on the King\'s knee, a white duck came swimming up the gutter to the kitchen, and said to the kitchen-boy, \"Boy, light a fire, that I may warm my feathers.\" The kitchen-boy did it, and lighted a fire on the hearth. Then came the duck and sat down by it, and shook herself and smoothed her feathers to rights with her bill. While she was thus sitting and enjoying herself, she asked, \"What is my brother Reginer doing?\" The scullery-boy replied, \"He is imprisoned in the pit with adders and with snakes.\" Then she asked, \"What is the black witch doing in the house?\" The boy answered, \"She is loved by the King and happy.\"\n\n\"May God have mercy on him,\" said the duck, and swam forth by the sink.\n\nThe next night she came again and put the same questions, and the third night also. Then the kitchen-boy could bear it no longer, and went to the King and discovered all to him. The King, however, wanted to see it for himself, and next evening went thither, and when the duck thrust her head in through the sink, he took his sword and cut through her neck, and suddenly she changed into a most beautiful maiden, exactly like the picture, which her brother had made of her. The King was full of joy, and as she stood there quite wet, he caused splendid apparel to be brought and had her clothed in it. Then she told how she had been betrayed by cunning and falsehood, and at last thrown down into the water, and her first request was that her brother should be brought forth from the pit of snakes, and when the King had fulfilled this request, he went into the chamber where the old witch was, and asked, What does she deserve who does this and that? and related what had happened. Then was she so blinded that she was aware of nothing and said, \"She deserves to be stripped naked, and put into a barrel with nails, and that a horse should be harnessed to the barrel, and the horse sent all over the world.\" All of which was done to her, and to her black daughter. But the King married the white and beautiful bride, and rewarded her faithful brother, and made him a rich and distinguished man.\n</string>
    <string name="story469text">Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest, and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said, \"Brother wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?\" - \"That is the King of birds,\" said the wolf, \"before whom we must bow down.\" It was, however, in reality the willow-wren (Zaunkönig). \"If that\'s the case,\" said the bear, \"I should very much like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.\" - \"That is not done quite as you seem to think,\" said the wolf; \"you must wait until the Queen comes.\" Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in her beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young ones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him back by the sleeve, and said, \"No, you must wait until the lord and lady Queen have gone away again.\" So they observed the hole in which was the nest, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he had seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, again went to it. The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw five or six young ones lying in it. \"Is that the royal palace?\" cried the bear; \"it is a wretched palace, and you are not King\'s children, you are disreputable children!\" When the young wrens heard that, they were frightfully angry, and screamed, \"No, that we are not! Our parents are honest people! Bear, thou wilt have to pay for that!\"\nThe bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their holes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and when their parents again brought food they said, \"We will not so much as touch one fly\'s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been here and has insulted us!\" Then the old King said, \"Be easy, he shall be punished,\" and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear\'s cave, and called in, \"Old Growler, why hast thou insulted my children? Thou shalt suffer for it we will punish thee by a bloody war.\" Thus war was announced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth contained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the air, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and flies had to come.\n\nWhen the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies to discover who was the enemy\'s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was the most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled, and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the watchword was to be given. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him and said, \"Fox, thou art the most cunning of all animals, thou shalt be general and lead us.\" - \"Good,\" said the fox, \"but what signal shall we agree upon?\" No one knew that, so the fox said, \"I have a fine long bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift my tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I let it hang down, run away as fast as you can.\" When the gnat had heard that, she flew away again, and revealed everything, with the greatest minuteness, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and the battle was to begin, all the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the earth trembled. The willow-wren also came flying through the air with his army with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one was uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each other. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to get beneath the fox\'s tail, and sting with all his might. When the fox felt the first sting, he started so that he drew up one leg, with the pain, but he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could hold out no longer, and screamed out and put his tail between his legs. When the animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to fly, each into his hole and the birds had won the battle.\n\nThen the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried, \"Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart\'s content, we have won the battle!\" But the young wrens said, \"We will not eat yet, the bear must come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honorable children, before we will do that.\" Then the willow-wren flew to the bear\'s hole and cried, \"Growler, thou art to come to the nest to my children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of thy body shall be broken.\" So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged their pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat down together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the night.</string>
    <string name="story470text">In former days every sound still had its meaning and application. When the smith\'s hammer resounded, it cried, \"Strike away! strike away.\" When the carpenter\'s plane grated, it said, \"Here goes! here goes.\" If the mill wheel began to clack, it said, \"Help, Lord God! help, Lord God!\" And if the miller was a cheat and happened to leave the mill, it spoke high German, and first asked slowly, \"Who is there? Who is there?\" and then answered quickly, \"The miller! the miller!\" and at last quite in a hurry, \"He steals bravely! he steals bravely! three pecks in a bushel.\"\nAt this time the birds also had their own language which every one understood; now it only sounds like chirping, screeching, and whistling, and to some like music without words. It came into the bird\'s mind, however, that they would no longer be without a ruler, and would choose one of themselves to be their King. One alone amongst them, the green plover, was opposed to this. He had lived free, and would die free, and anxiously flying hither and thither, he cried, \"Where shall I go? where shall I go?\" He retired into a solitary and unfrequented marsh, and showed himself no more among his fellows.\n\nThe birds now wished to discuss the matter, and on a fine May morning they all gathered together from the woods and fields: eagles and chaffinches, owls and crows, larks and sparrows, how can I name them all? Even the cuckoo came, and the hoopoe, his clerk, who is so called because he is always heard a few days before him, and a very small bird which as yet had no name, mingled with the band. The hen, which by some accident had heard nothing of the whole matter, was astonished at the great assemblage. \"What, what, what is going to be done?\" she cackled; but the cock calmed his beloved hen, and said, \"Only rich people,\" and told her what they had on hand. It was decided, however, that the one who could fly the highest should be King. A tree-frog which was sitting among the bushes, when he heard that, cried a warning, \"No, no, no! no!\" because he thought that many tears would be shed because of this; but the crow said, \"Caw, caw,\" and that all would pass off peaceably. It was now determined that on this fine morning they should at once begin to ascend, so that hereafter no one should be able to say, \"I could easily have flown much higher, but the evening came on, and I could do no more.\" On a given signal, therefore, the whole troop rose up in the air. The dust ascended from the land, and there was tremendous fluttering and whirring and beating of wings, and it looked as if a black cloud was rising up. The little birds were, however, soon left behind. They could go no farther, and fell back to the ground. The larger birds held out longer, but none could equal the eagle, who mounted so high that he could have picked the eyes out of the sun. And when he saw that the others could not get up to him, he thought, \"Why shouldst thou fly still higher, thou art the King?\" and began to let himself down again. The birds beneath him at once cried to him. \"Thou must be our King, no one has flown so high as thou.\" - \"Except me,\" screamed the little fellow without a name, who had crept into the breast-feathers of the eagle. And as he was not at all tired, he rose up and mounted so high that he reached heaven itself. When, however, he had gone as far as this, he folded his wings together, and called down with clear and penetrating voice, \"I am King! I am King.\"\n\n\"Thou, our King?\" cried the birds angrily. \"Thou hast compassed it by trick and cunning!\" So they made another condition. He should be King who could go down lowest in the ground. How the goose did flap about with its broad breast when it was once more on the land! How quickly the cock scratched a hole! The duck came off the worst of all, for she leapt into a ditch, but sprained her legs, and waddled away to a neighboring pond, crying, \"Cheating, cheating!\" The little bird without a name, however, sought out a mouse- hole, slipped down into it, and cried out of it with his small voice, \"I am King! I am King!\"\n\n\"Thou our King!\" cried the birds still more angrily. \"Dost thou think thy cunning shall prevail?\" They determined to keep him a prisoner in the hole and starve him out. The owl was placed as sentinel in front of it, and was not to let the rascal out if she had any value for her life. When evening was come all the birds were feeling very tired after exerting their wings so much, so they went to bed with their wives and children. The owl alone remained standing by the mouse-hole, gazing steadfastly into it with her great eyes. In the meantime she, too, had grown tired and thought to herself, \"You might certainly shut one eye, you will still watch with the other, and the little miscreant shall not come out of his hole.\" So she shut one eye, and with the other looked straight at the mouse-hole. The little fellow put his head out and peeped, and wanted to slip away, but the owl came forward immediately, and he drew his head back again. Then the owl opened the one eye again, and shut the other, intending to shut them in turn all through the night.\n\nBut when she next shut the one eye, she forgot to open the other, and as soon as both her eyes were shut she fell asleep. The little fellow soon observed that, and slipped away.\n\nFrom that day forth, the owl has never dared to show herself by daylight, for if she does the other birds chase her and pluck her feathers out. She only flies out by night, but hates and pursues mice because they make such ugly holes. The little bird, too, is very unwilling to let himself be seen, because he is afraid it will cost him his life if he is caught. He steals about in the hedges, and when he is quite safe, he sometimes cries, \"I am King,\" and for this reason, the other birds call him in mockery, \'King of the hedges\' (Zaunkönig). No one, however, was so happy as the lark at not having to obey the little King. As soon as the sun appears, she ascends high in the air and cries, \"Ah, how beautiful that is! beautiful that is! beautiful, beautiful! ah, how beautiful that is!\"</string>
    <string name="story471text">One day a peasant took his good hazel-stick out of the corner and said to his wife, \"Trina, I am going across country, and shall not return for three days. If during that time the cattle-dealer should happen to call and want to buy our three cows, you may strike a bargain at once, but not unless you can get two hundred thalers for them; nothing less, do you hear?\" - \"For heaven\'s sake just go in peace,\" answered the woman, \"I will manage that.\" - \"You, indeed,\" said the man. \"You once fell on your head when you were a little child, and that affects you even now; but let me tell you this, if you do anything foolish, I will make your back black and blue, and not with paint, I assure you, but with the stick which I have in my hand, and the colouring shall last a whole year, you may rely on that.\" And having said that, the man went on his way.\nNext morning the cattle-dealer came, and the woman had no need to say many words to him. When he had seen the cows and heard the price, he said, \"I am quite willing to give that, honestly speaking, they are worth it. I will take the beasts away with me at once.\" He unfastened their chains and drove them out of the byre, but just as he was going out of the yard-door, the woman clutched him by the sleeve and said, \"You must give me the two hundred thalers now, or I cannot let the cows go.\" - \"True,\" answered the man, \"but I have forgotten to buckle on my money-belt. Have no fear, however, you shall have security for my paying. I will take two cows with me and leave one, and then you will have a good pledge.\" The woman saw the force of this, and let the man go away with the cows, and thought to herself, \"How pleased Hans will be when he finds how cleverly I have managed it!\" The peasant came home on the third day as he had said he would, and at once inquired if the cows were sold? \"Yes, indeed, dear Hans,\" answered the woman, \"and as you said, for two hundred thalers. They are scarcely worth so much, but the man took them without making any objection.\" - \"Where is the money?\" asked the peasant. \"Oh, I have not got the money,\" replied the woman; \"he had happened to forget his money-belt, but he will soon bring it, and he left good security behind him.\" - \"What kind of security?\" asked the man. \"One of the three cows, which he shall not have until he has paid for the other two. I have managed very cunningly, for I have kept the smallest, which eats the least.\" The man was enraged and lifted up his stick, and was just going to give her the beating he had promised her. Suddenly he let the stick fail and said, \"You are the stupidest goose that ever waddled on God\'s earth, but I am sorry for you. I will go out into the highways and wait for three days to see if I find anyone who is still stupider than you. If I succeed in doing so, you shall go scot-free, but if I do not find him, you shall receive your well-deserved reward without any discount.\"\n\nHe went out into the great highways, sat down on a stone, and waited for what would happen. Then he saw a peasant\'s waggon coming towards him, and a woman was standing upright in the middle of it, instead of sitting on the bundle of straw which was lying beside her, or walking near the oxen and leading them. The man thought to himself, \"That is certainly one of the kind I am in search of,\" and jumped up and ran backwards and forwards in front of the waggon like one who is not very wise. \"What do you want, my friend?\" said the woman to him; \"I don\'t know you, where do you come from?\" - \"I have fallen down from heaven,\" replied the man, \"and don\'t know how to get back again, couldn\'t you drive me up?\" - \"No,\" said the woman, \"I don\'t know the way, but if you come from heaven you can surely tell me how my husband, who has been there these three years is. You must have seen him?\" - \"Oh, yes, I have seen him, but all men can\'t get on well. He keeps sheep, and the sheep give him a great deal to do. They run up the mountains and lose their way in the wilderness, and he has to run after them and drive them together again. His clothes are all torn to pieces too, and will soon fall off his body. There is no tailor there, for Saint Peter won\'t let any of them in, as you know by the story.\" - \"Who would have thought it?\" cried the woman, \"I tell you what, I will fetch his Sunday coat which is still hanging at home in the cupboard, he can wear that and look respectable. You will be so kind as to take it with you.\" - \"That won\'t do very well,\" answered the peasant; \"people are not allowed to take clothes into Heaven, they are taken away from one at the gate.\" - \"Then hark you,\" said the woman, \"I sold my fine wheat yesterday and got a good lot of money for it, I will send that to him. If you hide the purse in your pocket, no one will know that you have it.\" - \"If you can\'t manage it any other way,\" said the peasant, \"I will do you that favor.\" - \"Just sit still where you are,\" said she, \"and I will drive home and fetch the purse, I shall soon be back again. I do not sit down on the bundle of straw, but stand up in the waggon, because it makes it lighter for the cattle.\" She drove her oxen away, and the peasant thought, \"That woman has a perfect talent for folly, if she really brings the money, my wife may think herself fortunate, for she will get no beating.\" It was not long before she came in a great hurry with the money, and with her own hands put it in his pocket. Before she went away, she thanked him again a thousand times for his courtesy.\n\nWhen the woman got home again, she found her son who had come in from the field. She told him what unlooked-for things had befallen her, and then added, \"I am truly delighted at having found an opportunity of sending something to my poor husband. Who would ever have imagined that he could be suffering for want of anything up in heaven?\" The son was full of astonishment. \"Mother,\" said he, \"it is not every day that a man comes from Heaven in this way, I will go out immediately, and see if he is still to be found; he must tell me what it is like up there, and how the work is done.\" He saddled the horse and rode off with all speed. He found the peasant who was sitting under a willow-tree, and was just going to count the money in the purse. \"Have you seen the man who has fallen down from Heaven?\" cried the youth to him. \"Yes,\" answered the peasant, \"he has set out on his way back there, and has gone up that hill, from whence it will be rather nearer; you could still catch him up, if you were to ride fast.\" - \"Alas,\" said the youth, \"I have been doing tiring work all day, and the ride here has completely worn me out; you know the man, be so kind as to get on my horse, and go and persuade him to come here.\" - \"Aha!\" thought the peasant, \"here is another who has no wick in his lamp!\" - \"Why should I not do you this favor?\" said he, and mounted the horse and rode off in a quick trot. The youth remained sitting there till night fell, but the peasant never came back. \"The man from Heaven must certainly have been in a great hurry, and would not turn back,\" thought he, \"and the peasant has no doubt given him the horse to take to my father.\" He went home and told his mother what had happened, and that he had sent his father the horse so that he might not have to be always running about. \"Thou hast done well,\" answered she, \"thy legs are younger than his, and thou canst go on foot.\"\n\nWhen the peasant got home, he put the horse in the stable beside the cow which he had as a pledge, and then went to his wife and said, \"Trina, as your luck would have it, I have found two who are still sillier fools than you; this time you escape without a beating, I will store it up for another occasion.\" Then he lighted his pipe, sat down in his grandfather\'s chair, and said, \"It was a good stroke of business to get a sleek horse and a great purse full of money into the bargain, for two lean cows. If stupidity always brought in as much as that, I would be quite willing to hold it in honor.\" So thought the peasant, but you no doubt prefer the simple folks.</string>
    <string name="story472text">How fortunate is the master, and how well all goes in his house, when he has a wise servant who listens to his orders and does not obey them, but prefers following his own wisdom. A clever John of this kind was once sent out by his master to seek a lost cow. He stayed away a long time, and the master thought, \"Faithful John does not spare any pains over his work!\" As, however, he did not come back at all, the master was afraid lest some misfortune had befallen him, and set out himself to look for him. He had to search a long time, but at last he perceived the boy who was running up and down a large field. \"Now, dear John,\" said the master when he had got up to him, \"hast thou found the cow which I sent thee to seek?\" - \"No, master,\" he answered, \"I have not found the cow, but then I have not looked for it.\" - \"Then what hast thou looked for, John?\" - \"Something better, and that luckily I have found.\" - \"What is that, John?\" - \"Three blackbirds,\" answered the boy. \"And where are they?\" asked the master. \"I see one of them, I hear the other, and I am running after the third,\" answered the wise boy.\nTake example by this, do not trouble yourselves about your masters or their orders, but rather do what comes into your head and pleases you, and then you will act just as wisely as prudent John.</string>
    <string name="story473text">There was once upon a time a tailor who had three sons, and only one goat. But as the goat supported the whole of them with her milk, she was obliged to have good food, and to be taken every day to pasture. The sons, therefore, did this, in turn. Once the eldest took her to the churchyard, where the finest herbs were to be found, and let her eat and run about there. At night when it was time to go home he asked, \"Goat, hast thou had enough?\" The goat answered,\n\"I have eaten so much,\nNot a leaf more I\'ll touch, meh! meh!\"\n\"Come home, then,\" said the youth, and took hold of the cord round her neck, led her into the stable and tied her up securely. \"Well,\" said the old tailor, \"has the goat had as much food as she ought?\" - \"Oh,\" answered the son, \"she has eaten so much, not a leaf more she\'ll touch.\" But the father wished to satisfy himself, and went down to the stable, stroked the dear animal and asked, \"Goat, art thou satisfied?\" The goat answered,\n\"Wherewithal should I be satisfied?\nAmong the graves I leapt about,\nAnd found no food, so went without, meh! meh!\"\n\"What do I hear?\" cried the tailor, and ran upstairs and said to the youth, \"Hollo, thou liar: thou saidest the goat had had enough, and hast let her hunger!\" and in his anger he took the yard-measure from the wall, and drove him out with blows.\n\nNext day it was the turn of the second son, who looked out for a place in the fence of the garden, where nothing but good herbs grew, and the goat cleared them all off.\n\nAt night when he wanted to go home, he asked, \"Goat, art thou satisfied?\" The goat answered,\n\"I have eaten so much,\nNot a leaf more I\'ll touch, meh! meh!\"\n\"Come home, then,\" said the youth, and led her home, and tied her up in the stable. \"Well,\" said the old tailor, \"has the goat had as much food as she ought?\" - \"Oh,\" answered the son, \"she has eaten so much, not a leaf more she\'ll touch.\" The tailor would not rely on this, but went down to the stable and said, \"Goat, hast thou had enough?\" The goat answered,\n\"Wherewithal should I be satisfied?\nAmong the graves I leapt about,\nAnd found no food, so went without, meh! meh!\"\n\"The godless wretch!\" cried the tailor, \"to let such a good animal hunger,\" and he ran up and drove the youth out of doors with the yard-measure.\n\nNow came the turn of the third son, who wanted to do the thing well, and sought out some bushes with the finest leaves, and let the goat devour them. In the evening when he wanted to go home, he asked, \"Goat, hast thou had enough?\" The goat answered,\n\"I have eaten so much,\nNot a leaf more I\'ll touch, meh! meh!\"\n\"Come home, then,\" said the youth, and led her into the stable, and tied her up. \"Well,\" said the old tailor, \"has the goat had a proper amount of food?\" - \"She has eaten so much, not a leaf more she\'ll touch.\" The tailor did not trust to that, but went down and asked, \"Goat, hast thou had enough?\" The wicked beast answered,\n\"Wherewithal should I be satisfied?\nAmong the graves I leapt about,\nAnd found no leaves, so went without, meh! meh!\"\n\"Oh, the brood of liars!\" cried the tailor, \"each as wicked and forgetful of his duty as the other! Ye shall no longer make a fool of me,\" and quite beside himself with anger, he ran upstairs and belabored the poor young fellow so vigorously with the yard-measure that he sprang out of the house.\n\nThe old tailor was now alone with his goat. Next morning he went down into the stable, caressed the goat and said, \"Come, my dear little animal, I will take thee to feed myself.\" He took her by the rope and conducted her to green hedges, and amongst milfoil, and whatever else goats like to eat. \"There thou mayest for once eat to thy heart\'s content,\" said he to her, and let her browse till evening. Then he asked, \"Goat, art thou satisfied?\" She replied,\n\"I have eaten so much,\nNot a leaf more I\'ll touch, meh! meh!\"\n\"Come home, then,\" said the tailor, and led her into the stable, and tied her fast. When he was going away, he turned round again and said, \"Well, art thou satisfied for once?\" But the goat did not behave the better to him, and cried,\n\"Wherewithal should I be satisfied?\nAmong the graves I leapt about,\nAnd found no leaves, so went without, meh! meh!\"\nWhen the tailor heard that, he was shocked, and saw clearly that he had driven away his three sons without cause. \"Wait, thou ungrateful creature,\" cried he, \"it is not enough to drive thee forth, I will mark thee so that thou wilt no more dare to show thyself amongst honest tailors.\" In great haste he ran upstairs, fetched his razor, lathered the goat\'s head, and shaved her as clean as the palm of his hand. And as the yard-measure would have been too good for her, he brought the horsewhip, and gave her such cuts with it that she ran away in violent haste.\n\nWhen the tailor was thus left quite alone in his house he fell into great grief, and would gladly have had his sons back again, but no one knew whither they were gone. The eldest had apprenticed himself to a joiner, and learnt industriously and indefatigably, and when the time came for him to go travelling, his master presented him with a little table which had no particular appearance, and was made of common wood, but it had one good property; if anyone set it out, and said, \"Little table, spread thyself,\" the good little table was at once covered with a clean little cloth, and a plate was there, and a knife and fork beside it, and dishes with boiled meats and roasted meats, as many as there was room for, and a great glass of red wine shone so that it made the heart glad. The young journeyman thought, \"With this thou hast enough for thy whole life,\" and went joyously about the world and never troubled himself at all whether an inn was good or bad, or if anything was to be found in it or not. When it suited him he did not enter an inn at all, but either on the plain, in a wood, a meadow, or wherever he fancied, he took his little table off his back, set it down before him, and said, \"Cover thyself,\" and then everything appeared that his heart desired. At length he took it into his head to go back to his father, whose anger would now be appeased, and who would now willingly receive him with his wishing-table. It came to pass that on his way home, he came one evening to an inn which was filled with guests. They bade him welcome, and invited him to sit and eat with them, for otherwise he would have difficulty in getting anything. \"No,\" answered the joiner, \"I will not take the few bites out of your mouths; rather than that, you shall be my guests.\" They laughed, and thought he was jesting with them; he, however, placed his wooden table in the middle of the room, and said, \"Little table, cover thyself.\" Instantly it was covered with food, so good that the host could never have procured it, and the smell of it ascended pleasantly to the nostrils of the guests. \"Fall to, dear friends,\" said the joiner; and the guests when they saw that he meant it, did not need to be asked twice, but drew near, pulled out their knives and attacked it valiantly. And what surprised them the most was that when a dish became empty, a full one instantly took its place of its own accord. The innkeeper stood in one corner and watched the affair; he did not at all know what to say, but thought, \"Thou couldst easily find a use for such a cook as that in thy kitchen.\" The joiner and his comrades made merry until late into the night; at length they lay down to sleep, and the young apprentice also went to bed, and set his magic table against the wall. The host\'s thoughts, however, let him have no rest; it occurred to him that there was a little old table in his lumber-room which looked just like the apprentice\'s and he brought it out quite softly, and exchanged it for the wishing-table. Next morning, the joiner paid for his bed, took up his table, never thinking that he had got a false one, and went his way. At mid-day he reached his father, who received him with great joy. \"Well, my dear son, what hast thou learnt?\" said he to him. \"Father, I have become a joiner.\" - \"A good trade,\" replied the old man; \"but what hast thou brought back with thee from thy apprenticeship?\" - \"Father, the best thing which I have brought back with me is this little table.\" The tailor inspected it on all sides and said, \"Thou didst not make a masterpiece when thou mad\'st that; it is a bad old table.\" - \"But it is a table which furnishes itself,\" replied the son. \"When I set it out, and tell it to cover itself, the most beautiful dishes stand on it, and a wine also, which gladdens the heart. Just invite all our relations and friends, they shall refresh and enjoy themselves for once, for the table will give them all they require.\" When the company was assembled, he put his table in the middle of the room and said, \"Little table, cover thyself,\" but the little table did not bestir itself, and remained just as bare as any other table which did not understand language. Then the poor apprentice became aware that his table had been changed, and was ashamed at having to stand there like a liar. The relations, however, mocked him, and were forced to go home without having eaten or drunk. The father brought out his patches again, and went on tailoring, but the son went to a master in the craft.\n\nThe second son had gone to a miller and had apprenticed himself to him. When his years were over, the master said, \"As thou hast conducted thyself so well, I give thee an ass of a peculiar kind, which neither draws a cart nor carries a sack.\" - \"To what use is he put, then?\" asked the young apprentice. \"He lets gold drop from his mouth,\" answered the miller. \"If thou settest him on a cloth and sayest \'Bricklebrit,\' the good animal will drop gold pieces for thee.\" - \"That is a fine thing,\" said the apprentice, and thanked the master, and went out into the world. When he had need of gold, he had only to say \"Bricklebrit\" to his ass, and it rained gold pieces, and he had nothing to do but pick them off the ground. Wheresoever he went, the best of everything was good enough for him, and the dearer the better, for he had always a full purse. When he had looked about the world for some time, he thought, \"Thou must seek out thy father; if thou goest to him with the gold-ass he will forget his anger, and receive thee well.\" It came to pass that he came to the same public-house in which his brother\'s table had been exchanged. He led his ass by the bridle, and the host was about to take the animal from him and tie him up, but the young apprentice said, \"Don\'t trouble yourself, I will take my grey horse into the stable, and tie him up myself too, for I must know where he stands.\" This struck the host as odd, and he thought that a man who was forced to look after his ass himself, could not have much to spend; but when the stranger put his hand in his pocket and brought out two gold pieces, and said he was to provide something good for him, the host opened his eyes wide, and ran and sought out the best he could muster. After dinner the guest asked what he owed. The host did not see why he should not double the reckoning, and said the apprentice must give two more gold pieces. He felt in his pocket, but his gold was just at an end. \"Wait an instant, sir host,\" said he, \"I will go and fetch some money;\" but he took the table-cloth with him. The host could not imagine what this could mean, and being curious, stole after him, and as the guest bolted the stable-door, he peeped through a hole left by a knot in the wood. The stranger spread out the cloth under the animal and cried, \"Bricklebrit,\" and immediately the beast began to let gold pieces fall, so that it fairly rained down money on the ground. \"Eh, my word,\" said the host, \"ducats are quickly coined there! A purse like that is not amiss.\" The guest paid his score, and went to bed, but in the night the host stole down into the stable, led away the master of the mint, and tied up another ass in his place. Early next morning the apprentice travelled away with his ass, and thought that he had his gold-ass. At mid-day he reached his father, who rejoiced to see him again, and gladly took him in. \"What hast thou made of thyself, my son?\" asked the old man. \"A miller,\" dear father, he answered. \"What hast thou brought back with thee from thy travels?\" - \"Nothing else but an ass.\" - \"There are asses enough here,\" said the father, \"I would rather have had a good goat.\" - \"Yes,\" replied the son, \"but it is no common ass, but a gold-ass, when I say \'Bricklebrit,\' the good beast opens its mouth and drops a whole sheetful of gold pieces. Just summon all our relations hither, and I will make them rich folks.\" - \"That suits me well,\" said the tailor, \"for then I shall have no need to torment myself any longer with the needle,\" and ran out himself and called the relations together. As soon as they were assembled, the miller bade them make way, spread out his cloth, and brought the ass into the room. \"Now watch,\" said he, and cried, \"Bricklebrit,\" but no gold pieces fell, and it was clear that the animal knew nothing of the art, for every ass does not attain such perfection. Then the poor miller pulled a long face, saw that he was betrayed, and begged pardon of the relatives, who went home as poor as they came. There was no help for it, the old man had to betake him to his needle once more, and the youth hired himself to a miller.\n\nThe third brother had apprenticed himself to a turner, and as that is skilled labour, he was the longest in learning. His brothers, however, told him in a letter how badly things had gone with them, and how the innkeeper had cheated them of their beautiful wishing-gifts on the last evening before they reached home. When the turner had served his time, and had to set out on his travels, as he had conducted himself so well, his master presented him with a sack and said, \"There is a cudgel in it.\" - \"I can put on the sack,\" said he, \"and it may be of good service to me, but why should the cudgel be in it? It only makes it heavy.\" - \"I will tell thee why,\" replied the master; \"if any one has done anything to injure thee, do but say, \'Out of the sack, Cudgel!\' and the cudgel will leap forth among the people, and play such a dance on their backs that they will not be able to stir or move for a week, and it will not leave off until thou sayest, \"Into the sack, Cudgel!\" The apprentice thanked him, and put the sack on his back, and when any one came too near him, and wished to attack him, he said, \"Out of the sack, Cudgel!\" and instantly the cudgel sprang out, and dusted the coat or jacket of one after the other on their backs, and never stopped until it had stripped it off them, and it was done so quickly, that before anyone was aware, it was already his own turn. In the evening the young turner reached the inn where his brothers had been cheated. He laid his sack on the table before him, and began to talk of all the wonderful things which he had seen in the world. \"Yes,\" said he, \"people may easily find a table which will cover itself, a gold-ass, and things of that kind — extremely good things which I by no means despise — but these are nothing in comparison with the treasure which I have won for myself, and am carrying about with me in my sack there.\" The inn-keeper pricked up his ears, \"What in the world can that be?\" thought he; \"the sack must be filled with nothing but jewels; I ought to get them cheap too, for all good things go in threes.\" When it was time for sleep, the guest stretched himself on the bench, and laid his sack beneath him for a pillow. When the inn-keeper thought his guest was lying in a sound sleep, he went to him and pushed and pulled quite gently and carefully at the sack to see if he could possibly draw it away and lay another in its place. The turner had, however, been waiting for this for a long time, and now just as the inn-keeper was about to give a hearty tug, he cried, \"Out of the sack, Cudgel!\" Instantly the little cudgel came forth, and fell on the inn-keeper and gave him a sound thrashing. The host cried for mercy; but the louder he cried, so much more heavily the cudgel beat the time on his back, until at length he fell to the ground exhausted. Then the turner said, \"If thou dost not give back the table which covers itself, and the gold-ass, the dance shall begin afresh.\" - \"Oh, no,\" cried the host, quite humbly, \"I will gladly produce everything, only make the accursed kobold creep back into the sack.\" Then said the apprentice, \"I will let mercy take the place of justice, but beware of getting into mischief again!\" So he cried, \"Into the sack, Cudgel!\" and let him have rest.\n\nNext morning the turner went home to his father with the wishing-table, and the gold-ass. The tailor rejoiced when he saw him once more, and asked him likewise what he had learned in foreign parts. \"Dear father,\" said he, \"I have become a turner.\" - \"A skilled trade,\" said the father. \"What hast thou brought back with thee from thy travels?\" - \"A precious thing, dear father,\" replied the son, \"a cudgel in the sack.\" - \"What!\" cried the father, \"a cudgel! That\'s worth thy trouble, indeed! From every tree thou can cut thyself one.\" - \"But not one like this, dear father. If I say, \'Out of the sack, Cudgel!\' the cudgel springs out and leads any one who means ill with me a weary dance, and never stops until he lies on the ground and prays for fair weather. Look you, with this cudgel have I got back the wishing-table and the gold-ass which the thievish inn-keeper took away from my brothers. Now let them both be sent for, and invite all our kinsmen. I will give them to eat and to drink, and will fill their pockets with gold into the bargain.\" The old tailor would not quite believe, but nevertheless got the relatives together. Then the turner spread a cloth in the room and led in the gold-ass, and said to his brother, \"Now, dear brother, speak to him.\" The miller said, \"Bricklebrit,\" and instantly the gold pieces fell down on the cloth like a thunder-shower, and the ass did not stop until every one of them had so much that he could carry no more. (I can see in thy face that thou also wouldst like to be there.) Then the turner brought the little table, and said, \"Now dear brother, speak to it.\" And scarcely had the carpenter said, \"Table, cover thyself,\" than it was spread and amply covered with the most exquisite dishes. Then such a meal took place as the good tailor had never yet known in his house, and the whole party of kinsmen stayed together till far in the night, and were all merry and glad. The tailor locked away needle and thread, yard-measure and goose, in a press, and lived with his three sons in joy and splendour.\n\nWhat, however, has become of the goat who was to blame for the tailor driving out his three sons? That I will tell thee. She was ashamed that she had a bald head, and ran to a fox\'s hole and crept into it. When the fox came home, he was met by two great eyes shining out of the darkness, and was terrified and ran away. A bear met him, and as the fox looked quite disturbed, he said, \"What is the matter with thee, brother Fox, why dost thou look like that?\" - \"Ah,\" answered Redskin, \"a fierce beast is in my cave and stared at me with its fiery eyes.\" - \"We will soon drive him out,\" said the bear, and went with him to the cave and looked in, but when he saw the fiery eyes, fear seized on him likewise; he would have nothing to do with the furious beast, and took to his heels. The bee met him, and as she saw that he was ill at ease, she said, \"Bear, thou art really pulling a very pitiful face; what has become of all thy gaiety?\" - \"It is all very well for thee to talk,\" replied the bear, \"a furious beast with staring eyes is in Redskin\'s house, and we can\'t drive him out.\" The bee said, \"Bear I pity thee, I am a poor weak creature whom thou wouldst not turn aside to look at, but still, I believe, I can help thee.\" She flew into the fox\'s cave, lighted on the goat\'s smoothly-shorn head, and stung her so violently, that she sprang up, crying \"Meh, meh,\" and ran forth into the world as if mad, and to this hour no one knows where she has gone.</string>
    <string name="story474text">The wolf had the fox with him, and whatsoever the wolf wished, that the fox was compelled to do, for he was the weaker, and he would gladly have been rid of his master. It chanced that once as they were going through the forest, the wolf said, \"Red-fox, get me something to eat, or else I will eat thee thyself.\" Then the fox answered, \"I know a farm-yard where there are two young lambs; if thou art inclined, we will fetch one of them.\" That suited the wolf, and they went thither, and the fox stole the little lamb, took it to the wolf, and went away. The wolf devoured it, but was not satisfied with one; he wanted the other as well, and went to get it. As, however, he did it so awkwardly, the mother of the little lamb heard him, and began to cry out terribly, and to bleat so that the farmer came running there. They found the wolf, and beat him so mercilessly, that he went to the fox limping and howling. \"Thou hast misled me finely,\" said he; \"I wanted to fetch the other lamb, and the country folks surprised me, and have beaten me to a jelly.\" The fox replied, \"Why art thou such a glutton?\"\nNext day they again went into the country, and the greedy wolf once more said, \"Red-fox, get me something to eat, or I will eat thee thyself.\" Then answered the fox, \"I know a farm-house where the wife is baking pancakes to-night; we will get some of them for ourselves.\" They went there, and the fox slipped round the house, and peeped and sniffed about until he discovered where the dish was, and then drew down six pancakes and carried them to the wolf. \"There is something for thee to eat,\" said he to him, and then went his way. The wolf swallowed down the pancakes in an instant, and said, \"They make one want more,\" and went thither and tore the whole dish down so that it broke in pieces. This made such a great noise that the woman came out, and when she saw the wolf she called the people, who hurried there, and beat him as long as their sticks would hold together, till with two lame legs, and howling loudly, he got back to the fox in the forest. \"How abominably thou hast misled me!\" cried he, \"the peasants caught me, and tanned my skin for me.\" But the fox replied, \"Why art thou such a glutton?\"\n\nOn the third day, when they were out together, and the wolf could only limp along painfully, he again said, \"Red-fox, get me something to eat, or I will eat thee thyself.\" The fox answered, \"I know a man who has been killing, and the salted meat is lying in a barrel in the cellar; we will get that.\" Said the wolf, \"I will go when thou dost, that thou mayest help me if I am not able to get away.\" - \"I am willing,\" said the fox, and showed him the by-paths and ways by which at length they reached the cellar. There was meat in abundance, and the wolf attacked it instantly and thought, \"There is plenty of time before I need leave off!\" The fox liked it also, but looked about everywhere, and often ran to the hole by which they had come in, and tried if his body was still thin enough to slip through it. The wolf said, \"Dear fox, tell me why thou art running here and there so much, and jumping in and out?\"\n\n\"I must see that no one is coming,\" replied the crafty fellow. \"Don\'t eat too much!\" Then said the wolf, \"I shall not leave until the barrel is empty.\" In the meantime the farmer, who had heard the noise of the fox\'s jumping, came into the cellar. When the fox saw him he was out of the hole at one bound. The wolf wanted to follow him, but he had made himself so fat with eating that he could no longer get through, but stuck fast. Then came the farmer with a cudgel and struck him dead, but the fox bounded into the forest, glad to be rid of the old glutton.</string>
    <string name="story475text">Once on a time the fox was talking to the wolf of the strength of man; how no animal could withstand him, and how all were obliged to employ cunning in order to preserve themselves from him. Then the wolf answered, \"If I had but the chance of seeing a man for once, I would set on him notwithstanding.\" - \"I can help thee to do that,\" said the fox. \"Come to me early to-morrow morning, and I will show thee one.\" The wolf presented himself betimes, and the fox took him out on the road by which the huntsmen went daily. First came an old discharged soldier. \"Is that a man?\" inquired the wolf. \"No,\" answered the fox, \"that was one.\" Afterwards came a little boy who was going to school. \"Is that a man?\" - \"No, that is going to be one.\" At length came a hunter with his double-barrelled gun at his back, and hanger by his side. Said the fox to the wolf, \"Look, there comes a man, thou must attack him, but I will take myself off to my hole.\" The wolf then rushed on the man. When the huntsman saw him he said, \"It is a pity that I have not loaded with a bullet,\" aimed, and fired his small shot in his face. The wolf pulled a very wry face, but did not let himself be frightened, and attacked him again, on which the huntsman gave him the second barrel. The wolf swallowed his pain, and rushed on the huntsman, but he drew out his bright hanger, and gave him a few cuts with it right and left, so that, bleeding everywhere, he ran howling back to the fox. \"Well, brother wolf,\" said the fox, \"how hast thou got on with man?\" - \"Ah!\" replied the wolf, \"I never imagined the strength of man to be what it is! First, he took a stick from his shoulder, and blew into it, and then something flew into my face which tickled me terribly; then he breathed once more into the stick, and it flew into my nose like lightning and hail; when I was quite close, he drew a white rib out of his side, and he beat me so with it that I was all but left lying dead.\" - \"See what a braggart thou art!\" said the fox. \"Thou throwest thy hatchet so far that thou canst not fetch it back again!\"</string>
    <string name="story476text">There was once an old goat who had seven little ones, and was as fond of them as ever mother was of her children. One day she had to go into the wood to fetch food for them, so she called them all round her. \"Dear children,\" said she, \"I am going out into the wood; and while I am gone, be on your guard against the wolf, for if he were once to get inside he would eat you up, skin, bones, and all. The wretch often disguises himself, but he may always be known by his hoarse voice and black paws.\" - \"Dear mother,\" answered the kids, \"you need not be afraid, we will take good care of ourselves.\" And the mother bleated good-bye, and went on her way with an easy mind.\n\nIt was not long before some one came knocking at the house-door, and crying out: \"Open the door, my dear children, your mother is come back, and has brought each of you something.\" But the little kids knew it was the wolf by the hoarse voice. \"We will not open the door,\" cried they; \"you are not our mother, she has a delicate and sweet voice, and your voice is hoarse; you must be the wolf.\" Then off went the wolf to a shop and bought a big lump of chalk, and ate it up to make his voice soft. And then he came back, knocked at the house-door, and cried: \"Open the door, my dear children, your mother is here, and has brought each of you something.\" But the wolf had put up his black paws against the window, and the kids seeing this, cried out, \"We will not open the door; our mother has no black paws like you; you must be the wolf.\" The wolf then ran to a baker. \"Baker,\" said he, \"I am hurt in the foot; pray spread some dough over the place.\" And when the baker had plastered his feet, he ran to the miller. \"Miller,\" said he, \"strew me some white meal over my paws.\" But the miller refused, thinking the wolf must be meaning harm to some one. \"If you don\'t do it,\" cried the wolf, \"I\'ll eat you up!\" And the miller was afraid and did as he was told. And that just shows what men are.\n\nAnd now came the rogue the third time to the door and knocked. \"Open, children!\" cried he. \"Your dear mother has come home, and brought you each something from the wood.\" - \"First show us your paws,\" said the kids, \"so that we may know if you are really our mother or not.\" And he put up his paws against the window, and when they saw that they were white, all seemed right, and they opened the door. And when he was inside they saw it was the wolf, and they were terrified and tried to hide themselves. One ran under the table, the second got into the bed, the third into the oven, the fourth in the kitchen, the fifth in the cupboard, the sixth under the sink, the seventh in the clock-case. But the wolf found them all, and gave them short shrift; one after the other he swallowed down, all but the youngest, who was hid in the clock-case. And so the wolf, having got what he wanted, strolled forth into the green meadows, and laying himself down under a tree, he fell asleep.\n\nNot long after, the mother goat came back from the wood; and, oh! what a sight met her eyes! the door was standing wide open, table, chairs, and stools, all thrown about, dishes broken, quilt and pillows torn off the bed. She sought her children, they were nowhere to be found. She called to each of them by name, but nobody answered, until she came to the name of the youngest. \"Here I am, mother,\" a little voice cried, \"here, in the clock case.\" And so she helped him out, and heard how the wolf had come, and eaten all the rest. And you may think how she cried for the loss of her dear children.\n\nAt last in her grief she wandered out of doors, and the youngest kid with her; and when they came into the meadow, there they saw the wolf lying under a tree, and snoring so that the branches shook. The mother goat looked at him carefully on all sides and she noticed how something inside his body was moving and struggling. Dear me! thought she, can it be that my poor children that he devoured for his evening meal are still alive? And she sent the little kid back to the house for a pair of shears, and needle, and thread. Then she cut the wolf\'s body open, and no sooner had she made one snip than out came the head of one of the kids, and then another snip, and then one after the other the six little kids all jumped out alive and well, for in his greediness the rogue had swallowed them down whole. How delightful this was! so they comforted their dear mother and hopped about like tailors at a wedding. \"Now fetch some good hard stones,\" said the mother, \"and we will fill his body with them, as he lies asleep.\" And so they fetched some in all haste, and put them inside him, and the mother sewed him up so quickly again that he was none the wiser.\n\nWhen the wolf at last awoke, and got up, the stones inside him made him feel very thirsty, and as he was going to the brook to drink, they struck and rattled one against another. And so he cried out:\n\"What is this I feel inside me\nKnocking hard against my bones?\nHow should such a thing betide me!\nThey were kids, and now they\'re stones.\"\nSo he came to the brook, and stooped to drink, but the heavy stones weighed him down, so he fell over into the water and was drowned. And when the seven little kids saw it they came up running. \"The wolf is dead, the wolf is dead!\" they cried, and taking hands, they danced with their mother all about the place.</string>
    <string name="story477text">There was once a wonderful musician, who went quite alone through a forest and thought of all manner of things, and when nothing was left for him to think about, he said to himself, \"Time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest, I will fetch hither a good companion for myself.\" Then he took his fiddle from his back, and played so that it echoed through the trees. It was not long before a wolf came trotting through the thicket towards him. \"Ah, here is a wolf coming! I have no desire for him!\" said the musician; but the wolf came nearer and said to him, \"Ah, dear musician, how beautifully thou dost play. I should like to learn that, too.\" - \"It is soon learnt,\" the musician replied, \"thou hast only to do all that I bid thee.\" - \"Oh, musician,\" said the wolf, \"I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master.\" The musician bade him follow, and when they had gone part of the way together, they came to an old oak-tree which was hollow inside, and cleft in the middle. \"Look,\" said the musician, \"if thou wilt learn to fiddle, put thy fore paws into this crevice.\" The wolf obeyed, but the musician quickly picked up a stone and with one blow wedged his two paws so fast that he was forced to stay there like a prisoner. \"Stay there until I come back again,\" said the musician, and went his way.\n\nAfter a while he again said to himself, \"Time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest, I will fetch hither another companion,\" and took his fiddle and again played in the forest. It was not long before a fox came creeping through the trees towards him. \"Ah, there\'s a fox coming!\" said the musician. \"I have no desire for him.\" The fox came up to him and said, \"Oh, dear musician, how beautifully thou dost play! I should like to learn that too.\" - \"That is soon learnt,\" said the musician. \"Thou hast only to do everything that I bid thee.\" - \"Oh, musician,\" then said the fox, \"I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master.\" - \"Follow me,\" said the musician; and when they had walked a part of the way, they came to a footpath, with high bushes on both sides of it. There the musician stood still, and from one side bent a young hazel-bush down to the ground, and put his foot on the top of it, then he bent down a young tree from the other side as well, and said, \"Now little fox, if thou wilt learn something, give me thy left front paw.\" The fox obeyed, and the musician fastened his paw to the left bough. \"Little fox,\" said he, \"now reach me thy right paw\" and he tied it to the right bough. When he had examined whether they were firm enough, he let go, and the bushes sprang up again, and jerked up the little fox, so that it hung struggling in the air. \"Wait there till I come back again,\" said the musician, and went his way.\n\nAgain he said to himself, \"Time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest, I will fetch hither another companion,\" so he took his fiddle, and the sound echoed through the forest. Then a little hare came springing towards him. \"Why, a hare is coming,\" said the musician, \"I do not want him.\" - \"Ah, dear musician,\" said the hare, \"how beautifully thou dost fiddle; I too, should like to learn that.\" - \"That is soon learnt,\" said the musician, \"thou hast only to do everything that I bid thee.\" - \"Oh, musician,\" replied the little hare, \"I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master.\" They went a part of the way together until they came to an open space in the forest, where stood an aspen tree. The musician tied a long string round the little hare\'s neck, the other end of which he fastened to the tree. \"Now briskly, little hare, run twenty times round the tree!\" cried the musician, and the little hare obeyed, and when it had run round twenty times, it had twisted the string twenty times round the trunk of the tree, and the little hare was caught, and let it pull and tug as it liked, it only made the string cut into its tender neck. \"Wait there till I come back,\" said the musician, and went onwards.\n\nThe wolf, in the meantime, had pushed and pulled and bitten at the stone, and had worked so long that he had set his feet at liberty and had drawn them once more out of the cleft. Full of anger and rage he hurried after the musician and wanted to tear him to pieces. When the fox saw him running, he began to lament, and cried with all his might, \"Brother wolf, come to my help, the musician has betrayed me!\" The wolf drew down the little tree, bit the cord in two, and freed the fox, who went with him to take revenge on the musician. They found the tied-up hare, whom likewise they delivered, and then they all sought the enemy together.\n\nThe musician had once more played his fiddle as he went on his way, and this time he had been more fortunate. The sound reached the ears of a poor wood-cutter, who instantly, whether he would or no, gave up his work and came with his hatchet under his arm to listen to the music. \"At last comes the right companion,\" said the musician, \"for I was seeking a human being, and no wild beast.\" And he began and played so beautifully and delightfully that the poor man stood there as if bewitched, and his heart leaped with gladness. And as he thus stood, the wolf, the fox, and the hare came up, and he saw well that they had some evil design. So he raised his glittering axe and placed himself before the musician, as if to say, \"Whoso wishes to touch him let him beware, for he will have to do with me!\" Then the beasts were terrified and ran back into the forest. The musician, however, played once more to the man out of gratitude, and then went onwards.\n</string>
    <string name="story478text">Once on a time a countryman had a son who was as big as a thumb, and did not become any bigger, and during several years did not grow one hair\'s breadth. Once when the father was going out to plough, the little one said, \"Father, I will go out with you.\" - \"Thou wouldst go out with me?\" said the father. \"Stay here, thou wilt be of no use out there, besides thou mightest get lost!\" Then Thumbling began to cry, and for the sake of peace his father put him in his pocket, and took him with him. When he was outside in the field, he took him out again, and set him in a freshly-cut furrow. Whilst he was there, a great giant came over the hill. \"Do thou see that great bogie?\" said the father, for he wanted to frighten the little fellow to make him good; \"he is coming to fetch thee.\" The giant, however, had scarcely taken two steps with his long legs before he was in the furrow. He took up little Thumbling carefully with two fingers, examined him, and without saying one word went away with him. His father stood by, but could not utter a sound for terror, and he thought nothing else but that his child was lost, and that as long as he lived he should never set eyes on him again.\nThe giant, however, carried him home, suckled him, and Thumbling grew and became tall and strong after the manner of giants. When two years had passed, the old giant took him into the forest, wanted to try him, and said, \"Pull up a stick for thyself.\" Then the boy was already so strong that he tore up a young tree out of the earth by the roots. But the giant thought, \"We must do better than that,\" took him back again, and suckled him two years longer. When he tried him, his strength had increased so much that he could tear an old tree out of the ground. That was still not enough for the giant; he again suckled him for two years, and when he then went with him into the forest and said, \"Now just tear up a proper stick for me,\" the boy tore up the strongest oak-tree from the earth, so that it split, and that was a mere trifle to him. \"Now that will do,\" said the giant, \"thou art perfect,\" and took him back to the field from whence he had brought him. His father was there following the plough. The young giant went up to him, and said, \"Does my father see what a fine man his son has grown into?\"\n\nThe farmer was alarmed, and said, \"No, thou art not my son; I don\'t want thee leave me!\" - \"Truly I am your son; allow me to do your work, I can plough as well as you, nay better.\" - \"No, no, thou art not my son; and thou canst not plough go away!\" However, as he was afraid of this great man, he left go of the plough, stepped back and stood at one side of the piece of land. Then the youth took the plough, and just pressed it with one hand, but his grasp was so strong that the plough went deep into the earth. The farmer could not bear to see that, and called to him, \"If thou art determined to plough, thou must not press so hard on it, that makes bad work.\" The youth, however, unharnessed the horses, and drew the plough himself, saying, \"Just go home, father, and bid my mother make ready a large dish of food, and in the meantime I will go over the field.\" Then the farmer went home, and ordered his wife to prepare the food; but the youth ploughed the field which was two acres large, quite alone, and then he harnessed himself to the harrow, and harrowed the whole of the land, using two harrows at once. When he had done it, he went into the forest, and pulled up two oak-trees, laid them across his shoulders, and hung on them one harrow behind and one before, and also one horse behind and one before, and carried all as if it had been a bundle of straw, to his parents\' house. When he entered the yard, his mother did not recognize him, and asked, \"Who is that horrible tall man?\" The farmer said, \"That is our son.\" She said, \"No that cannot be our son, we never had such a tall one, ours was a little thing.\" She called to him, \"Go away, we do not want thee!\" The youth was silent, but led his horses to the stable, gave them some oats and hay, and all that they wanted. When he had done this, he went into the parlour, sat down on the bench and said, \"Mother, now I should like something to eat, will it soon be ready?\" Then she said, \"Yes,\" and brought in two immense dishes full of food, which would have been enough to satisfy herself and her husband for a week. The youth, however, ate the whole of it himself, and asked if she had nothing more to set before him. \"No,\" she replied, \"that is all we have.\" - \"But that was only a taste, I must have more.\" She did not dare to oppose him, and went and put a huge cauldron full of food on the fire, and when it was ready, carried it in. \"At length come a few crumbs,\" said he, and ate all there was, but it was still not sufficient to appease his hunger. Then said he, \"Father, I see well that with you I shall never have food enough; if you will get me an iron staff which is strong, and which I cannot break against my knees, I will go out into the world.\" The farmer was glad, put his two horses in his cart, and fetched from the smith a staff so large and thick, that the two horses could only just bring it away. The youth laid it across his knees, and snap! he broke it in two in the middle like a bean-stalk, and threw it away. The father then harnessed four horses, and brought a bar which was so long and thick, that the four horses could only just drag it. The son snapped this also in twain against his knees, threw it away, and said, \"Father, this can be of no use to me, you must harness more horses, and bring a stronger staff.\" So the father harnessed eight horses, and brought one which was so long and thick, that the eight horses could only just carry it. When the son took it in his hand, he broke off a bit from the top of it also, and said, \"Father, I see that you will not be able to procure me any such staff as I want, I will remain no longer with you.\"\n\nSo he went away, and gave out that he was a smith\'s apprentice. He arrived at a village, wherein lived a smith who was a greedy fellow, who never did a kindness to any one, but wanted everything for himself. The youth went into the smithy and asked if he needed a journeyman. \"Yes,\" said the smith, and looked at him, and thought, \"That is a strong fellow who will strike out well, and earn his bread.\" So he asked, \"How much wages dost thou want?\" - \"I don\'t want any at all,\" he replied, \"only every fortnight, when the other journeymen are paid, I will give thee two blows, and thou must bear them.\" The miser was heartily satisfied, and thought he would thus save much money. Next morning, the strange journeyman was to begin to work, but when the master brought the glowing bar, and the youth struck his first blow, the iron flew asunder, and the anvil sank so deep into the earth, that there was no bringing it out again. Then the miser grew angry, and said, \"Oh, but I can\'t make any use of you, you strike far too powerfully; what will you have for the one blow?\"\n\nThen said he, \"I will only give you quite a small blow, that\'s all.\" And he raised his foot, and gave him such a kick that he flew away over four loads of hay. Then he sought out the thickest iron bar in the smithy for himself, took it as a stick in his hand and went onwards.\n\nWhen he had walked for some time, he came to a small farm, and asked the bailiff if he did not require a head-servant. \"Yes,\" said the bailiff, \"I can make use of one; you look a strong fellow who can do something, how much a year do you want as wages?\" He again replied that he wanted no wages at all, but that every year he would give him three blows, which he must bear. Then the bailiff was satisfied, for he, too, was a covetous fellow. Next morning all the servants were to go into the wood, and the others were already up, but the head-servant was still in bed. Then one of them called to him, \"Get up, it is time; we are going into the wood, and thou must go with us.\" - \"Ah,\" said he quite roughly and surlily, \"you may just go, then; I shall be back again before any of you.\" Then the others went to the bailiff, and told him that the head-man was still lying in bed, and would not go into the wood with them. The bailiff said they were to awaken him again, and tell him to harness the horses. The head-man, however, said as before, \"Just go there, I shall be back again before any of you.\" And then he stayed in bed two hours longer. At length he arose from the feathers, but first he got himself two bushels of peas from the loft, made himself some broth with them, ate it at his leisure, and when that was done, went and harnessed the horses, and drove into the wood. Not far from the wood was a ravine through which he had to pass, so he first drove the horses on, and then stopped them, and went behind the cart, took trees and brushwood, and made a great barricade, so that no horse could get through. When he was entering the wood, the others were just driving out of it with their loaded carts to go home; then said he to them, \"Drive on, I will still get home before you do.\" He did not drive far into the wood, but at once tore two of the very largest trees of all out of the earth, threw them on his cart, and turned round. When he came to the barricade, the others were still standing there, not able to get through. \"Don\'t you see,\" said he, \"that if you had stayed with me, you would have got home just as quickly, and would have had another hour\'s sleep?\" He now wanted to drive on, but his horses could not work their way through, so he unharnessed them, laid them on the top of the cart, took the shafts in his own hands, and pulled it all through, and he did this just as easily as if it had been laden with feathers. When he was over, he said to the others, \"There, you see, I have got over quicker than you,\" and drove on, and the others had to stay where they were. In the yard, however, he took a tree in his hand, showed it to the bailiff, and said, \"Isn\'t that a fine bundle of wood?\" Then said the bailiff to his wife, \"The servant is a good one, if he does sleep long, he is still home before the others.\" So he served the bailiff for a year, and when that was over, and the other servants were getting their wages, he said it was time for him to take his too. The bailiff, however, was afraid of the blows which he was to receive, and earnestly entreated him to excuse him from having them; for rather than that, he himself would be head-servant, and the youth should be bailiff. \"No,\" said he, \"I will not be a bailiff, I am head-servant, and will remain so, but I will administer that which we agreed on.\" The bailiff was willing to give him whatsoever he demanded, but it was of no use, the head-servant said no to everything. Then the bailiff did not know what to do, and begged for a fortnight\'s delay, for he wanted to find some way of escape. The head-servant consented to this delay. The bailiff summoned all his clerks together, and they were to think the matter over, and give him advice. The clerks pondered for a long time, but at last they said that no one was sure of his life with the head-servant, for he could kill a man as easily as a midge, and that the bailiff ought to make him get into the well and clean it, and when he was down below, they would roll up one of the mill-stones which was lying there, and throw it on his head; and then he would never return to daylight. The advice pleased the bailiff, and the head-servant was quite willing to go down the well. When he was standing down below at the bottom, they rolled down the largest mill-stone and thought they had broken his skull, but he cried, \"Chase away those hens from the well, they are scratching in the sand up there, and throwing the grains into my eyes, so that I can\'t see.\" So the bailiff cried, \"Sh-sh,\" and pretended to frighten the hens away. When the head-servant had finished his work, he climbed up and said, \"Just look what a beautiful neck-tie I have on,\" and behold it was the mill-stone which he was wearing round his neck. The head-servant now wanted to take his reward, but the bailiff again begged for a fortnight\'s delay. The clerks met together and advised him to send the head-servant to the haunted mill to grind corn by night, for from thence as yet no man had ever returned in the morning alive. The proposal pleased the bailiff, he called the head-servant that very evening, and ordered him to take eight bushels of corn to the mill, and grind it that night, for it was wanted. So the head-servant went to the loft, and put two bushels in his right pocket, and two in his left, and took four in a wallet, half on his back, and half on his breast, and thus laden went to the haunted mill. The miller told him that he could grind there very well by day, but not by night, for the mill was haunted, and that up to the present time whosoever had gone into it at night had been found in the morning lying dead inside. He said, \"I will manage it, just you go away to bed.\" Then he went into the mill, and poured out the corn. About eleven o\'clock he went into the miller\'s room, and sat down on the bench. When he had sat there a while, a door suddenly opened, and a large table came in, and on the table, wine and roasted meats placed themselves, and much good food besides, but everything came of itself, for no one was there to carry it. After this the chairs pushed themselves up, but no people came, until all at once he beheld fingers, which handled knives and forks, and laid food on the plates, but with this exception he saw nothing. As he was hungry, and saw the food, he, too, place himself at the table, ate with those who were eating and enjoyed it. When he had had enough, and the others also had quite emptied their dishes, he distinctly heard all the candles being suddenly snuffed out, and as it was now pitch dark, he felt something like a box on the ear. Then he said, \"If anything of that kind comes again, I shall strike out in return.\" And when he had received a second box on the ear, he, too struck out. And so it continued the whole night. He took nothing without returning it, but repaid everything with interest, and did not lay about him in vain. At daybreak, however, everything ceased. When the miller had got up, he wanted to look after him, and wondered if he were still alive. Then the youth said, \"I have eaten my fill, have received some boxes on the ears, but I have given some in return.\" The miller rejoiced, and said that the mill was now released from the spell, and wanted to give him much money as a reward. But he said, \"Money, I will not have, I have enough of it.\" So he took his meal on his back, went home, and told the bailiff that he had done what he had been told to do, and would now have the reward agreed on. When the bailiff heard that, he was seriously alarmed and quite beside himself; he walked backwards and forwards in the room, and drops of perspiration ran down from his forehead. Then he opened the window to get some fresh air, but before he was aware, the head-servant had given him such a kick that he flew through the window out into the air, and so far away that no one ever saw him again. Then said the head-servant to the bailiff\'s wife, \"If he does not come back, you must take the other blow.\" She cried, \"No, no I cannot bear it,\" and opened the other window, because drops of perspiration were running down her forehead. Then he gave her such a kick that she, too, flew out, and as she was lighter she went much higher than her husband. Her husband cried, \"Do come to me,\" but she replied, \"Come thou to me, I cannot come to thee.\" And they hovered about there in the air, and could not get to each other, and whether they are still hovering about, or not, I do not know, but the young giant took up his iron bar, and went on his way.</string>

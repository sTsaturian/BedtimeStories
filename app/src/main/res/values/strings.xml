    <string name="story0text">A Shepherd Boy tended his master\'s Sheep near a dark forest not far from the village. Soon he found life in the pasture very dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd\'s pipe.\n\n.\nOne day as he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest, and thinking what he would do should he see a Wolf, he thought of a plan to amuse himself.\n\nHis Master had told him to call for help should a Wolf attack the flock, and the Villagers would drive it away. So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a Wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice, \"Wolf! Wolf!\"\n\nAs he expected, the Villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they got there they found the Boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played on them.\n\nA few days later the Shepherd Boy again shouted, \"Wolf! Wolf!\" Again the Villagers ran to help him, only to be laughed at again.\n\nThen one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the shadows were creeping out over the pasture, a Wolf really did spring from the underbrush and fall upon the Sheep.\n\nIn terror the Boy ran toward the village shouting \"Wolf! Wolf!\" But though the Villagers heard the cry, they did not run to help him as they had before. \"He cannot fool us again,\" they said.\n\nThe Wolf killed a great many of the Boy\'s sheep and then slipped away into the forest.\n\nMoral: Liars are not believed even when they speak the truth.</string>
    <string name="story1text">A certain Father had a family of Sons, who were forever quarreling among themselves. No words he could say did the least good, so he cast about in his mind for some very striking example that should make them see that discord would lead them to misfortune.\n\nOne day when the quarreling had been much more violent than usual and each of the Sons was moping in a surly manner, he asked one of them to bring him a bundle of sticks. Then handing the bundle to each of his Sons in turn he told them to try to break it. But although each one tried his best, none was able to do so.\n\nThe Father then untied the bundle and gave the sticks to his Sons to break one by one. This they did very easily.\n\n\"My Sons,\" said the Father, \"do you not see how certain it is that if you agree with each other and help each other, it will be impossible for your enemies to injure you? But if you are divided among yourselves, you will be no stronger than a single stick in that bundle.\"\n\nMoral: In unity is strength.</string>
    <string name="story2text">One bright morning as the Fox was following his sharp nose through the wood in search of a bite to eat, he saw a Crow on the limb of a tree overhead. This was by no means the first Crow the Fox had ever seen. What caught his attention this time and made him stop for a second look, was that the lucky Crow held a bit of cheese in her beak.\n\n\"No need to search any farther,\" thought sly Master Fox. \"Here is a dainty bite for my breakfast.\"\n\nUp he trotted to the foot of the tree in which the Crow was sitting, and looking up admiringly, he cried, \"Good-morning, beautiful creature!\"\n\nThe Crow, her head cocked on one side, watched the Fox suspiciously. But she kept her beak tightly closed on the cheese and did not return his greeting.\n\n\"What a charming creature she is!\" said the Fox. \"How her feathers shine! What a beautiful form and what splendid wings! Such a wonderful Bird should have a very lovely voice, since everything else about her is so perfect. Could she sing just one song, I know I should hail her Queen of Birds.\"\n\nListening to these flattering words, the Crow forgot all her suspicion, and also her breakfast. She wanted very much to be called Queen of Birds. So she opened her beak wide to utter her loudest caw, and down fell the cheese straight into the Fox\'s open mouth.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Master Fox sweetly, as he walked off. \"Though it is cracked, you have a voice sure enough. But where are your wits?\"\n\nMoral: The flatterer lives at the expense of those who will listen to him.</string>
    <string name="story3text">A Lion lay asleep in the forest, his great head resting on his paws. A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away, ran across the Lion\'s nose. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her.\n\n\"Spare me!\" begged the poor Mouse. \"Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you.\"\n\nThe Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.\n\nSome days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter\'s net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free.\n\n\"You laughed when I said I would repay you,\" said the Mouse. \"Now you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion.\"\n\nMoral: A kindness is never wasted.</string>
    <string name="story4text">A Hare was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow.\n\n\"Do you ever get anywhere?\" he asked with a mocking laugh.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Tortoise, \"and I get there sooner than you think. I\'ll run you a race and prove it.\"\n\nThe Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the Fox, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance and started the runners off.\n\nThe Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Hare, he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up.\n\n\nThe Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the Hare was sleeping. But the Hare slept on very peacefully; and when at last he did wake up, the Tortoise was near the goal. The Hare now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time.\n\nMoral: The race is not always to the swift.</string>
    <string name="story5text">The Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger. Suddenly they saw a traveller coming down the road, and the Sun said, \"I see a way to decide our dispute. Whichever of us can cause that traveller to take off his cloak shall be regarded as the stronger. You begin.\" So the Sun retired behind a cloud, and the Wind began to blow as hard as it could upon the traveller. But the harder he blew the more closely did the traveller wrap his cloak round him, till at last the Wind had to give up in despair. Then the Sun came out and shone in all his glory upon the traveller, who soon found it too hot to walk with his cloak on.</string>
    <string name="story6text">A certain Wolf could not get enough to eat because of the watchfulness of the Shepherds. But one night he found a sheep skin that had been cast aside and forgotten. The next day, dressed in the skin, the Wolf strolled into the pasture with the Sheep. Soon a little Lamb was following him about and was quickly led away to slaughter.\n\nThat evening the Wolf entered the fold with the flock. But it happened that the Shepherd took a fancy for mutton broth that very evening, and, picking up a knife, went to the fold. There the first he laid hands on and killed was the Wolf.\n\nMoral: The evil doer often comes to harm through his own deceit.</string>
    <string name="story7text">Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little riding hood of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else; so she was always called \'Little Red Riding Hood.\'\n\nOne day her mother said to her: \'Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing; and when you go into her room, don\'t forget to say, \"Good morning\", and don\'t peep into every corner before you do it.\'\n\n\'I will take great care,\' said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, and gave her hand on it.\n\nThe grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.\n\n\'Good day, Little Red Riding Hood,\' said he.\n\n\'Thank you kindly, wolf.\'\n\n\'Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?\'\n\n\'To my grandmother\'s.\'\n\n\'What have you got in your apron?\'\n\n\'Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.\'\n\n\'Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?\'\n\n\'A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you surely must know it,\' replied Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nThe wolf thought to himself: \'What a tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful - she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both.\'\n\nSo he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Hood, and then he said: \'See, Little Red Riding Hood, how pretty the flowers are about here - why do you not look round? I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.\'\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought: \'Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time.\'\n\nSo she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.\n\nMeanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother\'s house and knocked at the door.\n\n\'Who is there?\'\n\n\'Little Red Riding Hood,\' replied the wolf. \'She is bringing cake and wine; open the door.\'\n\n\'Lift the latch,\' called out the grandmother, \'I am too weak, and cannot get up.\'\n\nThe wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother\'s bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.\n\nShe was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself: \'Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.\' She called out: \'Good morning,\' but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.\n\n\'Oh! grandmother,\' she said, \'what big ears you have!\'\n\n\'All the better to hear you with, my child,\' was the reply.\n\n\'But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!\' she said.\n\n\'All the better to see you with, my dear.\'\n\n\'But, grandmother, what large hands you have!\'\n\n\'All the better to hug you with.\'\n\n\'Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!\'\n\n\'All the better to eat you with!\'\n\nAnd scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red Riding Hood.\n\nWhen the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud.\n\nThe huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself: \'How the old woman is snoring! I must just see if she wants anything.\' So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it.\n\n\'Do I find you here, you old sinner!\' said he. \'I have long sought you!\' But just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf.\n\nWhen he had made two snips, he saw the little red riding hood shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying: \'Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was inside the wolf.\'\n\nAfter that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red Riding Hood, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf\'s belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.\n\nThen all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf\'s skin and went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Red Riding Hood had brought, and revived. But Red Riding Hood thought to herself: \'As long as I live, I will never leave the path by myself to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.\'\n\nIt is also related that once, when Red Riding Hood was again taking cakes to the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path. Red Riding Hood, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said \'good morning\' to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up.\n\n\'Well,\' said the grandmother, \'we will shut the door, so that he can not come in.\'\n\nSoon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried: \'Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red Riding Hood, and am bringing you some cakes.\'\n\nBut they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until Red Riding Hood went home in the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts.\n\nIn front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the child: \'Take the pail, Red Riding Hood; I made some sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.\'\n\nRed Riding Hood carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned. But Red Riding Hood went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again.</string>
    <string name="story8text">There were once a man and a woman who had long, in vain, wished for a child. At length it appeared that God was about to grant their desire.\n\nThese people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world.\n\nOne day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion, and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it. She quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable.\n\nHer husband was alarmed, and asked: \'What ails you, dear wife?\'\n\n\'Ah,\' she replied, \'if I can\'t eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.\'\n\nThe man, who loved her, thought: \'Sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.\'\n\nAt twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It tasted so good to her - so very good, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before.\n\nIf he was to have any rest, her husband knew he must once more descend into the garden. Therefore, in the gloom of evening, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him.\n\n\'How can you dare,\' said she with angry look, \'descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!\'\n\n\'Ah,\' answered he, \'let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat.\'\n\nThe enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him: \'If the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.\'\n\nThe man in his terror consented to everything.\n\nWhen the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.\n\nRapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower in the middle of a forest. The tower had neither stairs nor door, but near the top was a little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried:\n\n\'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nLet down your hair to me.\'\nRapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress, she unfastened her braided tresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.\n\nAfter a year or two, it came to pass that the king\'s son rode through the forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened. It was Rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king\'s son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it.\n\nOnce when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:\n\n\'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nLet down your hair to me.\'\nThen Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her.\n\n\'If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too will try my fortune,\' said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried:\n\n\'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nLet down your hair to me.\'\nImmediately the hair fell down and the king\'s son climbed up.\n\nAt first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her; but the king\'s son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought: \'He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does\'; and she said yes, and laid her hand in his.\n\nShe said: \'I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.\'\n\nThey agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said to her: \'Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king\'s son - he is with me in a moment.\'\n\n\'Ah! you wicked child,\' cried the enchantress. \'What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have deceived me!\'\n\nIn her anger she clutched Rapunzel\'s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery.\n\nOn the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the window, and when the king\'s son came and cried:\n\n\'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nLet down your hair to me.\'\nShe let the hair down. The king\'s son ascended, but instead of finding his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks.\n\n\'Aha!\' she cried mockingly, \'you would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost to you; you will never see her again.\'\n\nThe king\'s son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes.\n\nHe wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented.</string>
    <string name="story9text">Once there was a miller who was poor, but who had a beautiful daughter. Now it happened that he had to go and speak to the king, and in order to make himself appear important he said to him, \"I have a daughter who can spin straw into gold.\"\n\nThe king said to the miller, \"That is an art which pleases me well, if your daughter is as clever as you say, bring her to-morrow to my palace, and I will put her to the test.\"\n\nAnd when the girl was brought to him he took her into a room which was quite full of straw, gave her a spinning-wheel and a reel, and said, \"Now set to work, and if by to-morrow morning early you have not spun this straw into gold during the night, you must die.\"\n\nThereupon he himself locked up the room, and left her in it alone. So there sat the poor miller\'s daughter, and for the life of her could not tell what to do, she had no idea how straw could be spun into gold, and she grew more and more frightened, until at last she began to weep.\n\nBut all at once the door opened, and in came a little man, and said, \"Good evening, mistress miller, why are you crying so?\"\n\n\"Alas,\" answered the girl, \"I have to spin straw into gold, and I do not know how to do it.\"\n\n\"What will you give me,\" said the manikin, \"if I do it for you?\"\n\n\"My necklace,\" said the girl.\n\nThe little man took the necklace, seated himself in front of the wheel, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three turns, and the reel was full, then he put another on, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three times round, and the second was full too. And so it went on until the morning, when all the straw was spun, and all the reels were full of gold.\n\nBy daybreak the king was already there, and when he saw the gold he was astonished and delighted, but his heart became only more greedy. He had the miller\'s daughter taken into another room full of straw, which was much larger, and commanded her to spin that also in one night if she valued her life. The girl knew not how to help herself, and was crying, when the door opened again, and the little man appeared, and said, \"What will you give me if I spin that straw into gold for you?\"\n\n\"The ring on my finger,\" answered the girl.\n\nThe little man took the ring, again began to turn the wheel, and by morning had spun all the straw into glittering gold.\n\nThe king rejoiced beyond measure at the sight, but still he had not gold enough, and he had the miller\'s daughter taken into a still larger room full of straw, and said, \"You must spin this, too, in the course of this night, but if you succeed, you shall be my wife.\"\n\nEven if she be a miller\'s daughter, thought he, I could not find a richer wife in the whole world.\n\nWhen the girl was alone the manikin came again for the third time, and said, \"What will you give me if I spin the straw for you this time also?\"\n\n\"I have nothing left that I could give,\" answered the girl.\n\n\"Then promise me, if you should become queen, to give me your first child.\"\n\nWho knows whether that will ever happen, thought the miller\'s daughter, and, not knowing how else to help herself in this strait, she promised the manikin what he wanted, and for that he once more spun the straw into gold.\n\nAnd when the king came in the morning, and found all as he had wished, he took her in marriage, and the pretty miller\'s daughter became a queen.\n\nA year after, she brought a beautiful child into the world, and she never gave a thought to the manikin. But suddenly he came into her room, and said, \"Now give me what you promised.\"\n\nThe queen was horror-struck, and offered the manikin all the riches of the kingdom if he would leave her the child. But the manikin said, \"No, something alive is dearer to me than all the treasures in the world.\"\n\nThen the queen began to lament and cry, so that the manikin pitied her.\n\n\"I will give you three days, time,\" said he, \"if by that time you find out my name, then shall you keep your child.\"\n\nSo the queen thought the whole night of all the names that she had ever heard, and she sent a messenger over the country to inquire, far and wide, for any other names that there might be. When the manikin came the next day, she began with Caspar, Melchior, Balthazar, and said all the names she knew, one after another, but to every one the little man said, \"That is not my name.\"\n\nOn the second day she had inquiries made in the neighborhood as to the names of the people there, and she repeated to the manikin the most uncommon and curious. Perhaps your name is Shortribs, or Sheepshanks, or Laceleg, but he always answered, \"That is not my name.\"\n\nOn the third day the messenger came back again, and said, \"I have not been able to find a single new name, but as I came to a high mountain at the end of the forest, where the fox and the hare bid each other good night, there I saw a little house, and before the house a fire was burning, and round about the fire quite a ridiculous little man was jumping, he hopped upon one leg, and shouted –\n\n\'To-day I bake, to-morrow brew,\nthe next I\'ll have the young queen\'s child.\nHa, glad am I that no one knew\nthat Rumpelstiltskin I am styled.\'\"\nYou may imagine how glad the queen was when she heard the name. And when soon afterwards the little man came in, and asked, \"Now, mistress queen, what is my name?\"\n\nAt first she said, \"Is your name Conrad?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Is your name Harry?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Perhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin?\"\n\n\"The devil has told you that! The devil has told you that,\" cried the little man, and in his anger he plunged his right foot so deep into the earth that his whole leg went in, and then in rage he pulled at his left leg so hard with both hands that he tore himself in two.</string>
    <string name="story10text">One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool spring of water with a rose in the middle of it, she sat herself down to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and catching it again as it fell.\n\nAfter a time she threw it up so high that she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled along on the ground, until at last it fell down into the spring. The princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so deep that she could not see the bottom of it. She began to cry, and said, \'Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the world.\'\n\nWhilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said, \'Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?\'\n\n\'Alas!\' said she, \'what can you do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.\'\n\nThe frog said, \'I do not want your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes; but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off your golden plate, and sleep on your bed, I will bring you your ball again.\'\n\n\'What nonsense,\' thought the princess, \'this silly frog is talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he shall have what he asks.\'\n\nSo she said to the frog, \'Well, if you will bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.\'\n\nThen the frog put his head down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the spring.\n\nAs soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.\n\nThe frog called after her, \'Stay, princess, and take me with you as you said,\'\n\nBut she did not stop to hear a word.\n\nThe next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a strange noise - tap, tap - plash, plash - as if something was coming up the marble staircase, and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the door, and a little voice cried out and said:\n\n\'Open the door, my princess dear,\nOpen the door to thy true love here!\nAnd mind the words that thou and I said\nBy the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.\'\nThen the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her seat.\n\nThe king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her, asked her what was the matter.\n\n\'There is a nasty frog,\' said she, \'at the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning. I told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come in.\'\n\nWhile she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:\n\n\'Open the door, my princess dear,\nOpen the door to thy true love here!\nAnd mind the words that thou and I said\nBy the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.\'\nThen the king said to the young princess, \'As you have given your word you must keep it; so go and let him in.\'\n\nShe did so, and the frog hopped into the room, and then straight on - tap, tap - plash, plash - from the bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where the princess sat.\n\n\'Pray lift me upon chair,\' said he to the princess, \'and let me sit next to you.\'\n\nAs soon as she had done this, the frog said, \'Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.\'\n\nThis she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, \'Now I am tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.\' And the princess, though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long.\n\nAs soon as it was light the frog jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.\n\n\'Now, then,\' thought the princess, \'at last he is gone, and I shall be troubled with him no more.\'\n\nBut she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:\n\n\'Open the door, my princess dear,\nOpen the door to thy true love here!\nAnd mind the words that thou and I said\nBy the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.\'\nAnd when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen and standing at the head of her bed.\n\nHe told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights.\n\n\'You,\' said the prince, \'have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for but that you should go with me into my father\'s kingdom, where I will marry you, and love you as long as you live.\'\n\nThe young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying \'Yes\' to all this; and as they spoke a brightly coloured coach drove up, with eight beautiful horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind the coach rode the prince\'s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.\n\nThey then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince\'s kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great many years.</string>
    <string name="story11text">Of course you know what is meant by a magnifying glass—one of those round spectacle-glasses that make everything look a hundred times bigger than it is? When any one takes one of these and holds it to his eye, and looks at a drop of water from the pond yonder, he sees above a thousand wonderful creatures that are otherwise never discerned in the water. But there they are, and it is no delusion. It almost looks like a great plateful of spiders jumping about in a crowd. And how fierce they are! They tear off each other\'s legs and arms and bodies, before and behind; and yet they are merry and joyful in their way.\n\nNow, there once was an old man whom all the people called Kribble-Krabble, for that was his name. He always wanted the best of everything, and when he could not manage it otherwise, he did it by magic.\n\nThere he sat one day, and held his magnifying-glass to his eye, and looked at a drop of water that had been taken out of a puddle by the ditch. But what a kribbling and krabbling was there! All the thousands of little creatures hopped and sprang and tugged at one another, and ate each other up.\n\n\"That is horrible!\" said old Kribble-Krabble. \"Can one not persuade them to live in peace and quietness, so that each one may mind his own business?\"\n\nAnd he thought it over and over, but it would not do, and so he had recourse to magic.\n\n\"I must give them color, that they may be seen more plainly,\" said he; and he poured something like a little drop of red wine into the drop of water, but it was witches\' blood from the lobes of the ear, the finest kind, at ninepence a drop. And now the wonderful little creatures were pink all over. It looked like a whole town of naked wild men.\n\n\"What have you there?\" asked another old magician, who had no name—and that was the best thing about him.\n\n\"Yes, if you can guess what it is,\" said Kribble-Krabble, \"I\'ll make you a present of it.\"\n\nBut it is not so easy to find out if one does not know.\n\nAnd the magician who had no name looked through the magnifying-glass.\n\nIt looked really like a great town reflected there, in which all the people were running about without clothes. It was terrible! But it was still more terrible to see how one beat and pushed the other, and bit and hacked, and tugged and mauled him. Those at the top were being pulled down, and those at the bottom were struggling upwards.\n\n\"Look! look! his leg is longer than mine! Bah! Away with it! There is one who has a little bruise. It hurts him, but it shall hurt him still more.\"\n\nAnd they hacked away at him, and they pulled at him, and ate him up, because of the little bruise. And there was one sitting as still as any little maiden, and wishing only for peace and quietness. But now she had to come out, and they tugged at her, and pulled her about, and ate her up.\n\n\"That\'s funny!\" said the magician.\n\n\"Yes; but what do you think it is?\" said Kribble-Krabble. \"Can you find that out?\"\n\n\"Why, one can see that easily enough,\" said the other. \"That\'s Paris, or some other great city, for they\'re all alike. It\'s a great city!\"\n\n\"It\'s a drop of puddle water!\" said Kribble-Krabble.</string>
    <string name="story12text">Many, many years ago lived an emperor, who thought so much of new clothes that he spent all his money in order to obtain them; his only ambition was to be always well dressed. He did not care for his soldiers, and the theatre did not amuse him; the only thing, in fact, he thought anything of was to drive out and show a new suit of clothes. He had a coat for every hour of the day; and as one would say of a king \"He is in his cabinet,\" so one could say of him, \"The emperor is in his dressing-room.\"\n\nThe great city where he resided was very gay; every day many strangers from all parts of the globe arrived. One day two swindlers came to this city; they made people believe that they were weavers, and declared they could manufacture the finest cloth to be imagined. Their colours and patterns, they said, were not only exceptionally beautiful, but the clothes made of their material possessed the wonderful quality of being invisible to any man who was unfit for his office or unpardonably stupid.\n\n\"That must be wonderful cloth,\" thought the emperor. \"If I were to be dressed in a suit made of this cloth I should be able to find out which men in my empire were unfit for their places, and I could distinguish the clever from the stupid. I must have this cloth woven for me without delay.\" And he gave a large sum of money to the swindlers, in advance, that they should set to work without any loss of time. They set up two looms, and pretended to be very hard at work, but they did nothing whatever on the looms. They asked for the finest silk and the most precious gold-cloth; all they got they did away with, and worked at the empty looms till late at night.\n\n\"I should very much like to know how they are getting on with the cloth,\" thought the emperor. But he felt rather uneasy when he remembered that he who was not fit for his office could not see it. Personally, he was of opinion that he had nothing to fear, yet he thought it advisable to send somebody else first to see how matters stood. Everybody in the town knew what a remarkable quality the stuff possessed, and all were anxious to see how bad or stupid their neighbours were.\n\n\"I shall send my honest old minister to the weavers,\" thought the emperor. \"He can judge best how the stuff looks, for he is intelligent, and nobody understands his office better than he.\"\n\nThe good old minister went into the room where the swindlers sat before the empty looms. \"Heaven preserve us!\" he thought, and opened his eyes wide, \"I cannot see anything at all,\" but he did not say so. Both swindlers requested him to come near, and asked him if he did not admire the exquisite pattern and the beautiful colours, pointing to the empty looms. The poor old minister tried his very best, but he could see nothing, for there was nothing to be seen. \"Oh dear,\" he thought, \"can I be so stupid? I should never have thought so, and nobody must know it! Is it possible that I am not fit for my office? No, no, I cannot say that I was unable to see the cloth.\"\n\n\"Now, have you got nothing to say?\" said one of the swindlers, while he pretended to be busily weaving.\n\n\"Oh, it is very pretty, exceedingly beautiful,\" replied the old minister looking through his glasses. \"What a beautiful pattern, what brilliant colours! I shall tell the emperor that I like the cloth very much.\"\n\n\"We are pleased to hear that,\" said the two weavers, and described to him the colours and explained the curious pattern. The old minister listened attentively, that he might relate to the emperor what they said; and so he did.\n\nNow the swindlers asked for more money, silk and gold-cloth, which they required for weaving. They kept everything for themselves, and not a thread came near the loom, but they continued, as hitherto, to work at the empty looms.\n\nSoon afterwards the emperor sent another honest courtier to the weavers to see how they were getting on, and if the cloth was nearly finished. Like the old minister, he looked and looked but could see nothing, as there was nothing to be seen.\n\n\"Is it not a beautiful piece of cloth?\" asked the two swindlers, showing and explaining the magnificent pattern, which, however, did not exist.\n\n\"I am not stupid,\" said the man. \"It is therefore my good appointment for which I am not fit. It is very strange, but I must not let any one know it;\" and he praised the cloth, which he did not see, and expressed his joy at the beautiful colours and the fine pattern. \"It is very excellent,\" he said to the emperor.\n\nEverybody in the whole town talked about the precious cloth. At last the emperor wished to see it himself, while it was still on the loom. With a number of courtiers, including the two who had already been there, he went to the two clever swindlers, who now worked as hard as they could, but without using any thread.\n\n\"Is it not magnificent?\" said the two old statesmen who had been there before. \"Your Majesty must admire the colours and the pattern.\" And then they pointed to the empty looms, for they imagined the others could see the cloth.\n\n\"What is this?\" thought the emperor, \"I do not see anything at all. That is terrible! Am I stupid? Am I unfit to be emperor? That would indeed be the most dreadful thing that could happen to me.\"\n\n\"Really,\" he said, turning to the weavers, \"your cloth has our most gracious approval;\" and nodding contentedly he looked at the empty loom, for he did not like to say that he saw nothing. All his attendants, who were with him, looked and looked, and although they could not see anything more than the others, they said, like the emperor, \"It is very beautiful.\" And all advised him to wear the new magnificent clothes at a great procession which was soon to take place. \"It is magnificent, beautiful, excellent,\" one heard them say; everybody seemed to be delighted, and the emperor appointed the two swindlers \"Imperial Court weavers.\"\n\nThe whole night previous to the day on which the procession was to take place, the swindlers pretended to work, and burned more than sixteen candles. People should see that they were busy to finish the emperor\'s new suit. They pretended to take the cloth from the loom, and worked about in the air with big scissors, and sewed with needles without thread, and said at last: \"The emperor\'s new suit is ready now.\"\n\nThe emperor and all his barons then came to the hall; the swindlers held their arms up as if they held something in their hands and said: \"These are the trousers!\" \"This is the coat!\" and \"Here is the cloak!\" and so on. \"They are all as light as a cobweb, and one must feel as if one had nothing at all upon the body; but that is just the beauty of them.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said all the courtiers; but they could not see anything, for there was nothing to be seen.\n\n\"Does it please your Majesty now to graciously undress,\" said the swindlers, \"that we may assist your Majesty in putting on the new suit before the large looking-glass?\"\n\nThe emperor undressed, and the swindlers pretended to put the new suit upon him, one piece after another; and the emperor looked at himself in the glass from every side.\n\n\"How well they look! How well they fit!\" said all. \"What a beautiful pattern! What fine colours! That is a magnificent suit of clothes!\"\n\nThe master of the ceremonies announced that the bearers of the canopy, which was to be carried in the procession, were ready.\n\n\"I am ready,\" said the emperor. \"Does not my suit fit me marvellously?\" Then he turned once more to the looking-glass, that people should think he admired his garments.\n\nThe chamberlains, who were to carry the train, stretched their hands to the ground as if they lifted up a train, and pretended to hold something in their hands; they did not like people to know that they could not see anything.\n\nThe emperor marched in the procession under the beautiful canopy, and all who saw him in the street and out of the windows exclaimed: \"Indeed, the emperor\'s new suit is incomparable! What a long train he has! How well it fits him!\" Nobody wished to let others know he saw nothing, for then he would have been unfit for his office or too stupid. Never emperor\'s clothes were more admired.\n\n\"But he has nothing on at all,\" said a little child at last. \"Good heavens! listen to the voice of an innocent child,\" said the father, and one whispered to the other what the child had said. \"But he has nothing on at all,\" cried at last the whole people. That made a deep impression upon the emperor, for it seemed to him that they were right; but he thought to himself, \"Now I must bear up to the end.\" And the chamberlains walked with still greater dignity, as if they carried the train which did not exist.</string>
    <string name="story13text">The Flea, the Grasshopper, and the Skipjack once wanted to see which of them could jump highest; and they invited the whole world, and whoever else would come, to see the grand sight. And there the three famous jumpers were met together in the room.\n\n\"Yes, I\'ll give my daughter to him who jumps highest,\" said the King, \"for it would be mean to let these people jump for nothing.\"\n\nThe Flea stepped out first. He had very pretty manners, and bowed in all directions, for he had young ladies\' blood in his veins, and was accustomed to consort only with human beings; and that was of great consequence.\n\nThen came the Grasshopper: he was certainly much heavier, but he had a good figure, and wore the green uniform that was born with him. This person, moreover, maintained that he belonged to a very old family in the land of Egypt, and that he was highly esteemed there. He had just come from the field, he said, and had been put into a card house three stories high, and all made of picture cards with the figures turned inwards. There were doors and windows in the house, cut in the body of the Queen of Hearts.\n\n\"I sing so,\" he said, \"that sixteen native crickets who have chirped from their youth up, and have never yet had a card house of their own, would become thinner than they are with envy if they were to hear me.\"\n\nBoth of them, the Flea and the Grasshopper, took care to announce who they were, and that they considered themselves entitled to marry a Princess.\n\nThe Skipjack said nothing, but it was said of him that he thought all the more; and directly the Yard Dog had smelt at him he was ready to assert that the Skipjack was of good family, and formed from the breastbone of an undoubted goose. The old councillor, who had received three medals for holding his tongue, declared that the Skipjack possessed the gift of prophecy; one could tell by his bones whether there would be a severe winter or a mild one; and that\'s more than one can always tell from the breastbone of the man who writes the almanac.\n\n\"I shall not say anything more,\" said the old King. \"I only go on quietly, and always think the best.\"\n\nNow they were to take their jump. The Flea sprang so high that no one could see him; and then they asserted that he had not jumped at all. That was very mean. The Grasshopper only sprang half as high, but he sprang straight into the King\'s face, and the King declared that was horribly rude. The Skipjack stood a long time considering; at last people thought that he could not jump at all.\n\n\"I only hope he\'s not become unwell,\" said the Yard Dog, and then he smelt at him again.\n\n\"Tap!\" he sprang with a little crooked jump just into the lap of the Princess, who sat on a low golden stool.\n\nThen the King said, \"The highest leap was taken by him who jumped up to my daughter; for therein lies the point; but it requires head to achieve that, and the Skipjack has shown that he has a head.\"\n\nAnd so he had the Princess.\n\n\"I jumped highest, after all,\" said the Flea. \"But it\'s all the same. Let her have the goose-bone with its lump of wax and bit of stick. I jumped to the highest; but in this world a body is required if one wishes to be seen.\"\n\nAnd the Flea went into foreign military service, where it is said he was killed.\n\nThe Grasshopper seated himself out in the ditch, and thought and considered how things happened in the world. And he too said, \"Body is required! body is required!\" And then he sang his own melancholy song, and from that we have gathered this story, which they say is not true, though it\'s in print.</string>
    <string name="story14text">In a nursery where a number of toys lay scattered about, a money-box stood on the top of a very high wardrobe. It was made of clay in the shape of a pig, and had been bought of the potter. In the back of the pig was a slit, and this slit had been enlarged with a knife, so that dollars, or crown pieces, might slip through; and, indeed there were two in the box, besides a number of pence. The money-pig was stuffed so full that it could no longer rattle, which is the highest state of perfection to which a money-pig can attain. There he stood upon the cupboard, high and lofty, looking down upon everything else in the room. He knew very well that he had enough inside him to buy up all the other toys, and this gave him a very good opinion of his own value. The rest thought of this fact also, although they did not express it, for there were so many other things to talk about. A large doll, still handsome, though rather old, for her neck had been mended, lay inside one of the drawers which was partly open. She called out to the others, \"Let us have a game at being men and women, that is something worth playing at.\"\n\nUpon this there was a great uproar; even the engravings, which hung in frames on the wall, turned round in their excitement, and showed that they had a wrong side to them, although they had not the least intention to expose themselves in this way, or to object to the game. It was late at night, but as the moon shone through the windows, they had light at a cheap rate. And as the game was now to begin, all were invited to take part in it, even the children\'s wagon, which certainly belonged to the coarser playthings. \"Each has its own value,\" said the wagon; \"we cannot all be noblemen; there must be some to do the work.\"\n\nThe money-pig was the only one who received a written invitation. He stood so high that they were afraid he would not accept a verbal message. But in his reply, he said, if he had to take a part, he must enjoy the sport from his own home; they were to arrange for him to do so; and so they did. The little toy theatre was therefore put up in such a way that the money-pig could look directly into it. Some wanted to begin with a comedy, and afterwards to have a tea party and a discussion for mental improvement, but they commenced with the latter first. The rocking-horse spoke of training and races; the wagon of railways and steam power, for these subjects belonged to each of their professions, and it was right they should talk of them. The clock talked politics—\"tick, tick;\" he professed to know what was the time of day, but there was a whisper that he did not go correctly. The bamboo cane stood by, looking stiff and proud: he was vain of his brass ferrule and silver top, and on the sofa lay two worked cushions, pretty but stupid. When the play at the little theatre began, the rest sat and looked on; they were requested to applaud and stamp, or crack, when they felt gratified with what they saw. But the riding-whip said he never cracked for old people, only for the young who were not yet married. \"I crack for everybody,\" said the cracker.\n\n\"Yes, and a fine noise you make,\" thought the audience, as the play went on.\n\nIt was not worth much, but it was very well played, and all the characters turned their painted sides to the audience, for they were made only to be seen on one side. The acting was wonderful, excepting that sometimes they came out beyond the lamps, because the wires were a little too long. The doll, whose neck had been darned, was so excited that the place in her neck burst, and the money-pig declared he must do something for one of the players, as they had all pleased him so much. So he made up his mind to remember one of them in his will, as the one to be buried with him in the family vault, whenever that event should happen. They all enjoyed the comedy so much, that they gave up all thoughts of the tea party, and only carried out their idea of intellectual amusement, which they called playing at men and women; and there was nothing wrong about it, for it was only play. All the while, each one thought most of himself, or of what the money-pig could be thinking. His thoughts were on, as he supposed, a very distant time—of making his will, and of his burial, and of when it might all come to pass. Certainly sooner than he expected—for all at once down he came from the top of the press, fell on the ground, and was broken to pieces. Then the pennies hopped and danced about in the most amusing manner. The little ones twirled round like tops, and the large ones rolled away as far as they could, especially the one great silver crown piece who had often to go out into the world, and now he had his wish as well as all the rest of the money. The pieces of the money-pig were thrown into the dust-bin, and the next day there stood a new money-pig on the cupboard, but it had not a farthing in its inside yet, and therefore, like the old one, it could not rattle. This was the beginning with him, and we will make it the end of our story.</string>
    <string name="story15text">Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to marry a princess; but she would have to be a real princess. He travelled all over the world to find one, but nowhere could he get what he wanted. There were princesses enough, but it was difficult to find out whether they were real ones. There was always something about them that was not as it should be. So he came home again and was sad, for he would have liked very much to have a real princess.\n\nOne evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in torrents. Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open it.\n\nIt was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. But, good gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look. The water ran down from her hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at the heels. And yet she said that she was a real princess.\n\nWell, we\'ll soon find that out, thought the old queen. But she said nothing, went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses.\n\nOn this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning she was asked how she had slept.\n\n\"Oh, very badly!\" said she. \"I have scarcely closed my eyes all night. Heaven only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying on something hard, so that I am black and blue all over my body. It\'s horrible!\"\n\nNow they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds.\n\nNobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that.\n\nSo the prince took her for his wife, for now he knew that he had a real princess; and the pea was put in the museum, where it may still be seen, if no one has stolen it.\n\nThere, that is a true story.</string>
    <string name="story16text">There was once a shilling, which came forth from the mint springing and shouting, \"Hurrah! now I am going out into the wide world.\" And truly it did go out into the wide world. The children held it with warm hands, the miser with a cold and convulsive grasp, and the old people turned it about, goodness knows how many times, while the young people soon allowed it to roll away from them. The shilling was made of silver, it contained very little copper, and considered itself quite out in the world when it had been circulated for a year in the country in which it had been coined. One day, it really did go out into the world, for it belonged to a gentleman who was about to travel in foreign lands. This gentleman was not aware that the shilling lay at the bottom of his purse when he started, till he one day found it between his fingers. \"Why,\" cried he, \"here is a shilling from home; well, it must go on its travels with me now!\" and the shilling jumped and rattled for joy, when it was put back again into the purse.\n\nHere it lay among a number of foreign companions, who were always coming and going, one taking the place of another, but the shilling from home was always put back, and had to remain in the purse, which was certainly a mark of distinction. Many weeks passed, during which the shilling had travelled a long distance in the purse, without in the least knowing where he was. He had found out that the other coins were French and Italian; and one coin said they were in this town, and another said they were in that, but the shilling was unable to make out or imagine what they meant. A man certainly cannot see much of the world if he is tied up in a bag, and this was really the shilling\'s fate. But one day, as he was lying in the purse, he noticed that it was not quite closed, and so he slipped near to the opening to have a little peep into society. He certainly had not the least idea of what would follow, but he was curious, and curiosity often brings its own punishment. In his eagerness, he came so near the edge of the purse that he slipped out into the pocket of the trousers; and when, in the evening, the purse was taken out, the shilling was left behind in the corner to which it had fallen. As the clothes were being carried into the hall, the shilling fell out on the floor, unheard and unnoticed by any one. The next morning the clothes were taken back to the room, the gentleman put them on, and started on his journey again; but the shilling remained behind on the floor. After a time it was found, and being considered a good coin, was placed with three other coins. \"Ah,\" thought the shilling, \"this is pleasant; I shall now see the world, become acquainted with other people, and learn other customs.\"\n\n\"Do you call that a shilling?\" said some one the next moment. \"That is not a genuine coin of the country,—it is false; it is good for nothing.\"\n\nNow begins the story as it was afterwards related by the shilling himself.\n\n\"\'False! good for nothing!\' said he. That remark went through and through me like a dagger. I knew that I had a true ring, and that mine was a genuine stamp. These people must at all events be wrong, or they could not mean me. But yes, I was the one they called \'false, and good for nothing.\'\n\n\"\'Then I must pay it away in the dark,\' said the man who had received me. So I was to be got rid of in the darkness, and be again insulted in broad daylight.\n\n\"\'False! good for nothing!\' Oh, I must contrive to get lost, thought I. And I trembled between the fingers of the people every time they tried to pass me off slyly as a coin of the country. Ah! unhappy shilling that I was! Of what use were my silver, my stamp, and my real value here, where all these qualities were worthless. In the eyes of the world, a man is valued just according to the opinion formed of him. It must be a shocking thing to have a guilty conscience, and to be sneaking about on account of wicked deeds. As for me, innocent as I was, I could not help shuddering before their eyes whenever they brought me out, for I knew I should be thrown back again up the table as a false pretender. At length I was paid away to a poor old woman, who received me as wages for a hard day\'s work. But she could not again get rid of me; no one would take me. I was to the woman a most unlucky shilling. \'I am positively obliged to pass this shilling to somebody,\' said she; \'I cannot, with the best intentions, lay by a bad shilling. The rich baker shall have it,—he can bear the loss better than I can. But, after all, it is not a right thing to do.\'\n\n\"\'Ah!\' sighed I to myself, \'am I also to be a burden on the conscience of this poor woman? Am I then in my old days so completely changed?\' The woman offered me to the rich baker, but he knew the current money too well, and as soon as he received me he threw me almost in the woman\'s face. She could get no bread for me, and I felt quite grieved to the heart that I should be cause of so much trouble to another, and be treated as a cast-off coin. I who, in my young days, felt so joyful in the certainty of my own value, and knew so well that I bore a genuine stamp. I was as sorrowful now as a poor shilling can be when nobody will have him. The woman took me home again with her, and looking at me very earnestly, she said, \'No, I will not try to deceive any one with thee again. I will bore a hole through thee, that everyone may know that thou art a false and worthless thing; and yet, why should I do that? Very likely thou art a lucky shilling. A thought has just struck me that it is so, and I believe it. Yes, I will make a hole in the shilling,\' said she, \'and run a string through it, and then give it to my neighbor\'s little one to hang round her neck, as a lucky shilling.\' So she drilled a hole through me.\n\n\"It is really not at all pleasant to have a hole bored through one, but we can submit to a great deal when it is done with a good intention. A string was drawn through the hole, and I became a kind of medal. They hung me round the neck of a little child, and the child laughed at me and kissed me, and I rested for one whole night on the warm, innocent breast of a child.\n\n\"In the morning the child\'s mother took me between her fingers, and had certain thoughts about me, which I very soon found out. First, she looked for a pair of scissors, and cut the string.\n\n\"\'Lucky shilling!\' said she, \'certainly this is what I mean to try.\' Then she laid me in vinegar till I became quite green, and after that she filled up the hole with cement, rubbed me a little to brighten me up, and went out in the twilight hour to the lottery collector, to buy herself a ticket, with a shilling that should bring luck. How everything seemed to cause me trouble. The lottery collector pressed me so hard that I thought I should crack. I had been called false, I had been thrown away,—that I knew; and there were many shillings and coins with inscriptions and stamps of all kinds lying about. I well knew how proud they were, so I avoided them from very shame. With the collector were several men who seemed to have a great deal to do, so I fell unnoticed into a chest, among several other coins.\n\n\"Whether the lottery ticket gained a prize, I know not; but this I know, that in a very few days after, I was recognized as a bad shilling, and laid aside. Everything that happened seemed always to add to my sorrow. Even if a man has a good character, it is of no use for him to deny what is said of him, for he is not considered an impartial judge of himself.\n\n\"A year passed, and in this way I had been changed from hand to hand; always abused, always looked at with displeasure, and trusted by no one; but I trusted in myself, and had no confidence in the world. Yes, that was a very dark time.\n\n\"At length one day I was passed to a traveller, a foreigner, the very same who had brought me away from home; and he was simple and true-hearted enough to take me for current coin. But would he also attempt to pass me? and should I again hear the outcry, \'False! good-for-nothing!\' The traveller examined me attentively, \'I took thee for good coin,\' said he; then suddenly a smile spread all over his face. I have never seen such a smile on any other face as on his. \'Now this is singular,\' said he, \'it is a coin from my own country; a good, true, shilling from home. Some one has bored a hole through it, and people have no doubt called it false. How curious that it should come into my hands. I will take it home with me to my own house.\'\n\n\"Joy thrilled through me when I heard this. I had been once more called a good, honest shilling, and I was to go back to my own home, where each and all would recognize me, and know that I was made of good silver, and bore a true, genuine stamp. I should have been glad in my joy to throw out sparks of fire, but it has never at any time been my nature to sparkle. Steel can do so, but not silver. I was wrapped up in fine, white paper, that I might not mix with the other coins and be lost; and on special occasions, when people from my own country happened to be present, I was brought forward and spoken of very kindly. They said I was very interesting, and it was really quite worth while to notice that those who are interesting have often not a single word to say for themselves.\n\n\"At length I reached home. All my cares were at an end. Joy again overwhelmed me; for was I not good silver, and had I not a genuine stamp? I had no more insults or disappointments to endure; although, indeed, there was a hole through me, as if I were false; but suspicions are nothing when a man is really true, and every one should persevere in acting honestly, for an will be made right in time. That is my firm belief,\" said the shilling.</string>
    <string name="story17text">On one of the Danish islands, where old Thingstones, the seats of justice of our forefathers, still stand in the cornfields, and huge trees rise in the forests of beech, there lies a little town whose low houses are covered with red tiles. In one of these houses strange things were brewing over the glowing coals on the open hearth; there was a boiling going on in glasses, and a mixing and distilling, while herbs were being cut up and pounded in mortars. An elderly man looked after it all.\n\n\"One must only do the right thing,\" he said; \"yes, the right—the correct thing. One must find out the truth concerning every created particle, and keep to that.\"\n\nIn the room with the good housewife sat her two sons; they were still small, but had great thoughts. Their mother, too, had always spoken to them of right and justice, and exhorted them to keep to the truth, which she said was the countenance of the Lord in this world.\n\nThe elder of the boys looked roguish and enterprising. He took a delight in reading of the forces of nature, of the sun and the moon; no fairy tale pleased him so much. Oh, how beautiful it must be, he thought, to go on voyages of discovery, or to find out how to imitate the wings of birds and then to be able to fly! Yes, to find that out was the right thing. Father was right, and mother was right—truth holds the world together.\n\nThe younger brother was quieter, and buried himself entirely in his books. When he read about Jacob dressing himself in sheep-skins to personify Esau, and so to usurp his brother\'s birthright, he would clench his little fist in anger against the deceiver; when he read of tyrants and of the injustice and wickedness of the world, tears would come into his eyes, and he was quite filled with the thought of the justice and truth which must and would triumph.\n\nOne evening he was lying in bed, but the curtains were not yet drawn close, and the light streamed in upon him; he had taken his book into bed with him, for he wanted to finish reading the story of Solon. His thoughts lifted and carried him away a wonderful distance; it seemed to him as if the bed had become a ship flying along under full sail. Was he dreaming, or what was happening? It glided over the rolling waves and across the ocean of time, and to him came the voice of Solon; spoken in a strange tongue, yet intelligible to him, he heard the Danish motto: \"By law the land is ruled.\"\n\nThe genius of the human race stood in the humble room, bent down over the bed and imprinted a kiss on the boy\'s forehead: \"Be thou strong in fame and strong in the battle of life! With truth in thy heart fly toward the land of truth!\"\n\nThe elder brother was not yet in bed; he was standing at the window looking out at the mist which rose from the meadows. They were not elves dancing out there, as their old nurse had told him; he knew better—they were vapours which were warmer than the air, and that is why they rose. A shooting star lit up the sky, and the boy\'s thoughts passed in a second from the vapours of the earth up to the shining meteor. The stars gleamed in the heavens, and it seemed as if long golden threads hung down from them to the earth.\n\n\"Fly with me,\" sang a voice, which the boy heard in his heart. And the mighty genius of mankind, swifter than a bird and than an arrow—swifter than anything of earthly origin—carried him out into space, where the heavenly bodies are bound together by the rays that pass from star to star. Our earth revolved in the thin air, and the cities upon it seemed to lie close to each other. Through the spheres echoed the words:\n\n\"What is near, what is far, when thou art lifted by the mighty genius of mind?\"\n\nAnd again the boy stood by the window, gazing out, whilst his younger brother lay in bed. Their mother called them by their names: \"Anders Sandoe\" and \"Hans Christian.\"\n\nDenmark and the whole world knows them—the two brothers Oersted.</string>
    <string name="story18text">An Ox came down to a reedy pool to drink. As he splashed heavily into the water, he crushed a young Frog into the mud.\n\nThe old Frog soon missed the little one and asked his brothers and sisters what had become of him.\n\n\"A great big monster,\" said one of them, \"stepped on little brother with one of his huge feet!\"\n\n\"Big, was he!\" said the old Frog, puffing herself up. \"Was he as big as this?\"\n\n\"Oh, much bigger!\" they cried.\n\nThe Frog puffed up still more.\n\n\n\"He could not have been bigger than this,\" she said. But the little Frogs all declared that the monster was much, much bigger and the old Frog kept puffing herself out more and more until, all at once, she burst.\n\nMoral: Do not attempt the impossible.</string>
    <string name="story19text">The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of their enemy, the Cat. At least they wished to find some way of knowing when she was coming, so they might have time to run away. Indeed, something had to be done, for they lived in such constant fear of her claws that they hardly dared stir from their dens by night or day.\n\nMany plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good enough. At last a very young Mouse got up and said:\n\n\"I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be successful.\n\nAll we have to do is to hang a bell about the Cat\'s neck. When we hear the bell ringing we will know immediately that our enemy is coming.\"\n\nAll the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of such a plan before. But in the midst of the rejoicing over their good fortune, an old Mouse arose and said:\n\n\"I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good. But let me ask one question: Who will bell the Cat?\"\n\nMoral: It is one thing to say that something should be done, but quite a different matter to do it.</string>
    <string name="story20text">A Town Mouse once visited a relative who lived in the country. For lunch the Country Mouse served wheat stalks, roots, and acorns, with a dash of cold water for drink. The Town Mouse ate very sparingly, nibbling a little of this and a little of that, and by her manner making it very plain that she ate the simple food only to be polite.\n\nAfter the meal the friends had a long talk, or rather the Town Mouse talked about her life in the city while the Country Mouse listened. They then went to bed in a cozy nest in the hedgerow and slept in quiet and comfort until morning. In her sleep the Country Mouse dreamed she was a Town Mouse with all the luxuries and delights of city life that her friend had described for her. So the next day when the Town Mouse asked the Country Mouse to go home with her to the city, she gladly said yes.\n\nWhen they reached the mansion in which the Town Mouse lived, they found on the table in the dining room the leavings of a very fine banquet. There were sweetmeats and jellies, pastries, delicious cheeses, indeed, the most tempting foods that a Mouse can imagine. But just as the Country Mouse was about to nibble a dainty bit of pastry, she heard a Cat mew loudly and scratch at the door. In great fear the Mice scurried to a hiding place, where they lay quite still for a long time, hardly daring to breathe. When at last they ventured back to the feast, the door opened suddenly and in came the servants to clear the table, followed by the House Dog.\n\n\nThe Country Mouse stopped in the Town Mouse\'s den only long enough to pick up her carpet bag and umbrella.\n\n\"You may have luxuries and dainties that I have not,\" she said as she hurried away, \"but I prefer my plain food and simple life in the country with the peace and security that go with it.\"\n\nMoral: Poverty with security is better than plenty in the midst of fear and uncertainty.</string>
    <string name="story21text">A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox\'s mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.\n\nThe bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.\n\nNow he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.\n\n\"What a fool I am,\" he said. \"Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for.\"\n\nAnd off he walked very, very scornfully.\n\nMoral: There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach.</string>
    <string name="story22text">A Wolf had been feasting too greedily, and a bone had stuck crosswise in his throat. He could get it neither up nor down, and of course he could not eat a thing. Naturally that was an awful state of affairs for a greedy Wolf.\n\nSo away he hurried to the Crane. He was sure that she, with her long neck and bill, would easily be able to reach the bone and pull it out.\n\n\"I will reward you very handsomely,\" said the Wolf, \"if you pull that bone out for me.\"\n\nThe Crane, as you can imagine, was very uneasy about putting her head in a Wolf\'s throat. But she was grasping in nature, so she did what the Wolf asked her to do.\n\nWhen the Wolf felt that the bone was gone, he started to walk away.\n\n\"But what about my reward!\" called the Crane anxiously.\n\n\"What!\" snarled the Wolf, whirling around. \"Haven\'t you got it? Isn\'t it enough that I let you take your head out of my mouth without snapping it off?\"\n\nMoral: Expect no reward for serving the wicked.</string>
    <string name="story23text">A Gnat flew over the meadow with much buzzing for so small a creature and settled on the tip of one of the horns of a Bull. After he had rested a short time, he made ready to fly away. But before he left he begged the Bull\'s pardon for having used his horn for a resting place.\n\n\"You must be very glad to have me go now,\" he said.\n\n\"It\'s all the same to me,\" replied the Bull. \"I did not even know you were there.\"\n\nMoral: We are often of greater importance in our own eyes than in the eyes of our neighbor. The smaller the mind the greater the conceit.</string>
    <string name="story24text">Two Travellers, walking in the noonday sun, sought the shade of a widespreading tree to rest. As they lay looking up among the pleasant leaves, they saw that it was a Plane Tree.\n\n\"How useless is the Plane!\" said one of them. \"It bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter the ground with leaves.\"\n\n\"Ungrateful creatures!\" said a voice from the Plane Tree. \"You lie here in my cooling shade, and yet you say I am useless! Thus ungratefully, O Jupiter, do men receive their blessings!\"\n\nMoral: Our best blessings are often the least appreciated.</string>
    <string name="story25text">The Owl always takes her sleep during the day. Then after sundown, when the rosy light fades from the sky and the shadows rise slowly through the wood, out she comes ruffling and blinking from the old hollow tree. Now her weird \"hoo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo\" echoes through the quiet wood, and she begins her hunt for the bugs and beetles, frogs and mice she likes so well to eat.\n\nNow there was a certain old Owl who had become very cross and hard to please as she grew older, especially if anything disturbed her daily slumbers. One warm summer afternoon as she dozed away in her den in the old oak tree, a Grasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy song. Out popped the old Owl\'s head from the opening in the tree that served her both for door and for window.\n\n\"Get away from here, sir,\" she said to the Grasshopper. \"Have you no manners? You should at least respect my age and leave me to sleep in quiet!\"\n\nBut the Grasshopper answered saucily that he had as much right to his place in the sun as the Owl had to her place in the old oak. Then he struck up a louder and still more rasping tune.\n\nThe wise old Owl knew quite well that it would do no good to argue with the Grasshopper, nor with anybody else for that matter. Besides, her eyes were not sharp enough by day to permit her to punish the Grasshopper as he deserved. So she laid aside all hard words and spoke very kindly to him.\n\n\"Well sir,\" she said, \"if I must stay awake, I am going to settle right down to enjoy your singing. Now that I think of it, I have a wonderful wine here, sent me from Olympus, of which I am told Apollo drinks before he sings to the high gods. Please come up and taste this delicious drink with me. I know it will make you sing like Apollo himself.\"\n\n\nThe foolish Grasshopper was taken in by the Owl\'s flattering words. Up he jumped to the Owl\'s den, but as soon as he was near enough so the old Owl could see him clearly, she pounced upon him and ate him up.\n\nMoral: Flattery is not a proof of true admiration. Do not let flattery throw you off your guard against an enemy.</string>
    <string name="story26text">A Giant Oak stood near a brook in which grew some slender Reeds. When the wind blew, the great Oak stood proudly upright with its hundred arms uplifted to the sky. But the Reeds bowed low in the wind and sang a sad and mournful song.\n\n\"You have reason to complain,\" said the Oak. \"The slightest breeze that ruffles the surface of the water makes you bow your heads, while I, the mighty Oak, stand upright and firm before the howling tempest.\"\n\n\"Do not worry about us,\" replied the Reeds. \"The winds do not harm us. We bow before them and so we do not break. You, in all your pride and strength, have so far resisted their blows. But the end is coming.\"\n\nAs the Reeds spoke a great hurricane rushed out of the north. The Oak stood proudly and fought against the storm, while the yielding Reeds bowed low. The wind redoubled in fury, and all at once the great tree fell, torn up by the roots, and lay among the pitying Reeds.\n\nMoral: Better to yield when it is folly to resist, than to resist stubbornly and be destroyed.</string>
    <string name="story27text">In a spell of dry weather, when the Birds could find very little to drink, a thirsty Crow found a pitcher with a little water in it. But the pitcher was high and had a narrow neck, and no matter how he tried, the Crow could not reach the water. The poor thing felt as if he must die of thirst.\n\nThen an idea came to him. Picking up some small pebbles, he dropped them into the pitcher one by one. With each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it was near enough so he could drink.\n\nMoral: In a pinch a good use of our wits may help us out.</string>
    <string name="story28text">Two Goats, frisking gayly on the rocky steeps of a mountain valley, chanced to meet, one on each side of a deep chasm through which poured a mighty mountain torrent. The trunk of a fallen tree formed the only means of crossing the chasm, and on this not even two squirrels could have passed each other in safety. The narrow path would have made the bravest tremble. Not so our Goats. Their pride would not permit either to stand aside for the other.\n\nOne set her foot on the log. The other did likewise. In the middle they met horn to horn. Neither would give way, and so they both fell, to be swept away by the roaring torrent below.\n\nMoral: It is better to yield than to come to misfortune through stubbornness.</string>
    <string name="story29text">A Wild Boar was sharpening his tusks busily against the stump of a tree, when a Fox happened by. Now the Fox was always looking for a chance to make fun of his neighbors. So he made a great show of looking anxiously about, as if in fear of some hidden enemy. But the Boar kept right on with his work.\n\n\"Why are you doing that?\" asked the Fox at last with a grin. \"There isn\'t any danger that I can see.\"\n\n\"True enough,\" replied the Boar, \"but when danger does come there will not be time for such work as this. My weapons will have to be ready for use then, or I shall suffer for it.\"\n\nMoral: Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace.</string>
    <string name="story30text">A Heron was walking sedately along the bank of a stream, his eyes on the clear water, and his long neck and pointed bill ready to snap up a likely morsel for his breakfast. The clear water swarmed with fish, but Master Heron was hard to please that morning.\n\n\"No small fry for me,\" he said. \"Such scanty fare is not fit for a Heron.\"\n\nNow a fine young Perch swam near.\n\n\"No indeed,\" said the Heron. \"I wouldn\'t even trouble to open my beak for anything like that!\"\n\nAs the sun rose, the fish left the shallow water near the shore and swam below into the cool depths toward the middle. The Heron saw no more fish, and very glad was he at last to breakfast on a tiny Snail.\n\nMoral: Do not be too hard to suit or you may have to be content with the worst or with nothing at all.</string>
    <string name="story31text">The Fox one day thought of a plan to amuse himself at the expense of the Stork, at whose odd appearance he was always laughing.\n\n\"You must come and dine with me today,\" he said to the Stork, smiling to himself at the trick he was going to play. The Stork gladly accepted the invitation and arrived in good time and with a very good appetite.\n\nFor dinner the Fox served soup. But it was set out in a very shallow dish, and all the Stork could do was to wet the very tip of his bill. Not a drop of soup could he get. But the Fox lapped it up easily, and, to increase the disappointment of the Stork, made a great show of enjoyment.\n\nThe hungry Stork was much displeased at the trick, but he was a calm, even-tempered fellow and saw no good in flying into a rage. Instead, not long afterward, he invited the Fox to dine with him in turn. The Fox arrived promptly at the time that had been set, and the Stork served a fish dinner that had a very appetizing smell. But it was served in a tall jar with a very narrow neck. The Stork could easily get at the food with his long bill, but all the Fox could do was to lick the outside of the jar, and sniff at the delicious odor. And when the Fox lost his temper, the Stork said calmly:\n\n\"Do not play tricks on your neighbors unless you can stand the same treatment yourself.\"</string>
    <string name="story32text">A Stag, drinking from a crystal spring, saw himself mirrored in the clear water. He greatly admired the graceful arch of his antlers, but he was very much ashamed of his spindling legs.\n\n\"How can it be,\" he sighed, \"that I should be cursed with such legs when I have so magnificent a crown.\"\n\nAt that moment he scented a panther and in an instant was bounding away through the forest. But as he ran his wide-spreading antlers caught in the branches of the trees, and soon the Panther overtook him. Then the Stag perceived that the legs of which he was so ashamed would have saved him had it not been for the useless ornaments on his head.\n\nWe often make much of the ornamental and despise the useful.</string>
    <string name="story33text">One bright evening as the sun was sinking on a glorious world a wise old Cock flew into a tree to roost. Before he composed himself to rest, he flapped his wings three times and crowed loudly. But just as he was about to put his head under his wing, his beady eyes caught a flash of red and a glimpse of a long pointed nose, and there just below him stood Master Fox.\n\n\"Have you heard the wonderful news?\" cried the Fox in a very joyful and excited manner.\n\n\"What news?\" asked the Cock very calmly. But he had a queer, fluttery feeling inside him, for, you know, he was very much afraid of the Fox.\n\n\"Your family and mine and all other animals have agreed to forget their differences and live in peace and friendship from now on forever. Just think of it! I simply cannot wait to embrace you! Do come down, dear friend, and let us celebrate the joyful event.\"\n\n\"How grand!\" said the Cock. \"I certainly am delighted at the news.\" But he spoke in an absent way, and stretching up on tiptoes, seemed to be looking at something afar off.\n\n\"What is it you see?\" asked the Fox a little anxiously.\n\n\"Why, it looks to me like a couple of Dogs coming this way. They must have heard the good news and—\"\n\nBut the Fox did not wait to hear more. Off he started on a run.\n\n\"Wait,\" cried the Cock. \"Why do you run? The Dogs are friends of yours now!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the Fox. \"But they might not have heard the news. Besides, I have a very important errand that I had almost forgotten about.\"\n\nThe Cock smiled as he buried his head in his feathers and went to sleep, for he had succeeded in outwitting a very crafty enemy.\n\nMoral: The trickster is easily tricked.</string>
    <string name="story34text">A Fox fell into a well, and though it was not very deep, he found that he could not get out again. After he had been in the well a long time, a thirsty Goat came by. The Goat thought the Fox had gone down to drink, and so he asked if the water was good.\n\n\"The finest in the whole country,\" said the crafty Fox, \"jump in and try it. There is more than enough for both of us.\"\n\nThe thirsty Goat immediately jumped in and began to drink. The Fox just as quickly jumped on the Goat\'s back and leaped from the tip of the Goat\'s horns out of the well\n\nThe foolish Goat now saw what a plight he had got into, and begged the Fox to help him out. But the Fox was already on his way to the woods\n\n\"If you had as much sense as you have beard, old fellow,\" he said as he ran, \"you would have been more cautious about finding a way to get out again before you jumped in.\"\n\nMoral: Look before you leap.</string>
    <string name="story35text">A Fox and a Leopard, resting lazily after a generous dinner, amused themselves by disputing about their good looks. The Leopard was very proud of his glossy, spotted coat and made disdainful remarks about the Fox, whose appearance he declared was quite ordinary.\n\nThe Fox prided himself on his fine bushy tail with its tip of white, but he was wise enough to see that he could not rival the Leopard in looks. Still he kept up a flow of sarcastic talk, just to exercise his wits and to have the fun of disputing. The Leopard was about to lose his temper when the Fox got up, yawning lazily.\n\n\"You may have a very smart coat,\" he said, \"but you would be a great deal better off if you had a little more smartness inside your head and less on your ribs, the way I am. That\'s what I call real beauty.\"\n\nMoral: A fine coat is not always an indication of an attractive mind.</string>
    <string name="story36text">A young Mouse in search of adventure was running along the bank of a pond where lived a Frog. When the Frog saw the Mouse, he swam to the bank and croaked:\n\n\"Won\'t you pay me a visit? I can promise you a good time if you do.\"\n\nThe Mouse did not need much coaxing, for he was very anxious to see the world and everything in it. But though he could swim a little, he did not dare risk going into the pond without some help.\n\nThe Frog had a plan. He tied the Mouse\'s leg to his own with a tough reed. Then into the pond he jumped, dragging his foolish companion with him. The Mouse soon had enough of it and wanted to return to shore; but the treacherous Frog had other plans. He pulled the Mouse down under the water and drowned him. But before he could untie the reed that bound him to the dead Mouse, a Hawk came sailing over the pond. Seeing the body of the Mouse floating on the water, the Hawk swooped down, seized the Mouse and carried it off, with the Frog dangling from its leg. Thus at one swoop he had caught both meat and fish for his dinner.\n\nMoral: Those who seek to harm others often come to harm themselves through their own deceit.</string>
    <string name="story37text">A Beetle once begged the Eagle to spare a Hare which had run to her for protection. But the Eagle pounced upon her prey, the sweep of her great wings tumbling the Beetle a dozen feet away. Furious at the disrespect shown her, the Beetle flew to the Eagle\'s nest and rolled out the eggs. Not one did she spare. The Eagle\'s grief and anger knew no bounds, but who had done the cruel deed she did not know.\n\nNext year the Eagle built her nest far up on a mountain crag; but the Beetle found it and again destroyed the eggs. In despair the Eagle now implored great Jupiter to let her place her eggs in his lap. There none would dare harm them. But the Beetle buzzed about Jupiter\'s head, and made him rise to drive her away; and the eggs rolled from his lap.\n\nNow the Beetle told the reason for her action, and Jupiter had to acknowledge the justice of her cause. And they say that ever after, while the Eagle\'s eggs lie in the nest in spring, the Beetle still sleeps in the ground. For so Jupiter commanded.\n\nMoral: Even the weakest may find means to avenge a wrong.</string>
    <string name="story38text">Early one morning a hungry Wolf was prowling around a cottage at the edge of a village, when he heard a child crying in the house. Then he heard the Mother\'s voice say:\n\n\"Hush, child, hush! Stop your crying, or I will give you to the Wolf!\"\n\nSurprised but delighted at the prospect of so delicious a meal, the Wolf settled down under an open window, expecting every moment to have the child handed out to him. But though the little one continued to fret, the Wolf waited all day in vain. Then, toward nightfall, he heard the Mother\'s voice again as she sat down near the window to sing and rock her baby to sleep.\n\n\"There, child, there! The Wolf shall not get you. No, no! Daddy is watching and Daddy will kill him if he should come near!\"\n\nJust then the Father came within sight of the home, and the Wolf was barely able to save himself from the Dogs by a clever bit of running.\n\nMoral: Do not believe everything you hear.</string>
    <string name="story39text">A Dog, to whom the butcher had thrown a bone, was hurrying home with his prize as fast as he could go. As he crossed a narrow footbridge, he happened to look down and saw himself reflected in the quiet water as if in a mirror. But the greedy Dog thought he saw a real Dog carrying a bone much bigger than his own.\n\nIf he had stopped to think he would have known better. But instead of thinking, he dropped his bone and sprang at the Dog in the river, only to find himself swimming for dear life to reach the shore. At last he managed to scramble out, and as he stood sadly thinking about the good bone he had lost, he realized what a stupid Dog he had been.\n\nMoral: It is very foolish to be greedy.</string>
    <string name="story40text">A Wolf left his lair one evening in fine spirits and an excellent appetite. As he ran, the setting sun cast his shadow far out on the ground, and it looked as if the wolf were a hundred times bigger than he really was.\n\n\"Why,\" exclaimed the Wolf proudly, \"see how big I am! Fancy me running away from a puny Lion! I\'ll show him who is fit to be king, he or I.\"\n\nJust then an immense shadow blotted him out entirely, and the next instant a Lion struck him down with a single blow.\n\nMoral: Do not let your fancy make you forget realities.</string>
    <string name="story41text">A Dove saw an Ant fall into a brook. The Ant struggled in vain to reach the bank, and in pity, the Dove dropped a blade of straw close beside it. Clinging to the straw like a shipwrecked sailor to a broken spar, the Ant floated safely to shore.\n\nSoon after, the Ant saw a man getting ready to kill the Dove with a stone. But just as he cast the stone, the Ant stung him in the heel, so that the pain made him miss his aim, and the startled Dove flew to safety in a distant wood.\n\nMoral: A kindness is never wasted.</string>
    <string name="story42text">A long time ago a Man met a Satyr in the forest and succeeded in making friends with him. The two soon became the best of comrades, living together in the Man\'s hut. But one cold winter evening, as they were walking homeward, the Satyr saw the Man blow on his fingers.\n\n\"Why do you do that?\" asked the Satyr.\n\n\"To warm my hands,\" the Man replied.\n\nWhen they reached home the Man prepared two bowls of porridge. These he placed steaming hot on the table, and the comrades sat down very cheerfully to enjoy the meal. But much to the Satyr\'s surprise, the Man began to blow into his bowl of porridge.\n\n\"Why do you do that?\" he asked.\n\n\"To cool my porridge,\" replied the Man.\n\nThe Satyr sprang hurriedly to his feet and made for the door.\n\n\"Goodby,\" he said, \"I\'ve seen enough. A fellow that blows hot and cold in the same breath cannot be friends with me!\"\n\nMoral: The man who talks for both sides is not to be trusted by either.</string>
    <string name="story43text">The Lion had been badly hurt by the horns of a Goat, which he was eating. He was very angry to think that any animal that he chose for a meal, should be so brazen as to wear such dangerous things as horns to scratch him while he ate. So he commanded that all animals with horns should leave his domains within twenty-four hours.\n\nThe command struck terror among the beasts. All those who were so unfortunate as to have horns, began to pack up and move out. Even the Hare, who, as you know, has no horns and so had nothing to fear, passed a very restless night, dreaming awful dreams about the fearful Lion.\n\nAnd when he came out of the warren in the early morning sunshine, and there saw the shadow cast by his long and pointed ears, a terrible fright seized him.\n\n\"Goodby, neighbor Cricket,\" he called. \"I\'m off. He will certainly make out that my ears are horns, no matter what I say.\"\n\nMoral: Do not give your enemies the slightest reason to attack your reputation. Your enemies will seize any excuse to attack you.</string>
    <string name="story44text">A poor Fisherman, who lived on the fish he caught, had bad luck one day and caught nothing but a very small fry. The Fisherman was about to put it in his basket when the little Fish said:\n\n\"Please spare me, Mr. Fisherman! I am so small it is not worth while to carry me home. When I am bigger, I shall make you a much better meal.\"\n\nBut the Fisherman quickly put the fish into his basket.\n\n\"How foolish I should be,\" he said, \"to throw you back. However small you may be, you are better than nothing at all.\"\n\nMoral: A small gain is worth more than a large promise.</string>
    <string name="story45text">There was once a little Kid whose growing horns made him think he was a grown-up Billy Goat and able to take care of himself. So one evening when the flock started home from the pasture and his mother called, the Kid paid no heed and kept right on nibbling the tender grass. A little later when he lifted his head, the flock was gone.\n\nHe was all alone. The sun was sinking. Long shadows came creeping over the ground. A chilly little wind came creeping with them making scary noises in the grass. The Kid shivered as he thought of the terrible Wolf. Then he started wildly over the field, bleating for his mother. But not half-way, near a clump of trees, there was the Wolf!\n\nThe Kid knew there was little hope for him.\n\n\"Please, Mr. Wolf,\" he said trembling, \"I know you are going to eat me. But first please pipe me a tune, for I want to dance and be merry as long as I can.\"\n\nThe Wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating, so he struck up a merry tune and the Kid leaped and frisked gaily.\n\nMeanwhile, the flock was moving slowly homeward. In the still evening air the Wolf\'s piping carried far. The Shepherd Dogs pricked up their ears. They recognized the song the Wolf sings before a feast, and in a moment they were racing back to the pasture. The Wolf\'s song ended suddenly, and as he ran, with the Dogs at his heels, he called himself a fool for turning piper to please a Kid, when he should have stuck to his butcher\'s trade.\n\nMoral: Do not let anything turn you from your purpose</string>
    <string name="story46text">The Tortoise, you know, carries his house on his back. No matter how hard he tries, he cannot leave home. They say that Jupiter punished him so, because he was such a lazy stay-at-home that he would not go to Jupiter\'s wedding, even when especially invited.\n\nAfter many years, Tortoise began to wish he had gone to that wedding. When he saw how gaily the birds flew about and how the Hare and the Chipmunk and all the other animals ran nimbly by, always eager to see everything there was to be seen, the Tortoise felt very sad and discontented. He wanted to see the world too, and there he was with a house on his back and little short legs that could hardly drag him along.\n\nOne day he met a pair of Ducks and told them all his trouble.\n\n\"We can help you to see the world,\" said the Ducks. \"Take hold of this stick with your teeth and we will carry you far up in the air where you can see the whole countryside. But keep quiet or you will be sorry.\"\n\nThe Tortoise was very glad indeed. He seized the stick firmly with his teeth, the two Ducks took hold of it one at each end, and away they sailed up toward the clouds.\n\nJust then a Crow flew by. He was very much astonished at the strange sight and cried:\n\n\"This must surely be the King of Tortoises!\"\n\n\"Why certainly—\" began the Tortoise.\n\nBut as he opened his mouth to say these foolish words he lost his hold on the stick, and down he fell to the ground, where he was dashed to pieces on a rock.\n\nMoral: Foolish curiosity and vanity often lead to misfortune.</string>
    <string name="story47text">\"Why in the world do you walk sideways like that?\" said a Mother Crab to her son. \"You should always walk straight forward with your toes turned out.\"\n\n\"Show me how to walk, mother dear,\" answered the little Crab obediently, \"I want to learn.\"\n\nSo the old Crab tried and tried to walk straight forward. But she could walk sideways only, like her son. And when she wanted to turn her toes out she tripped and fell on her nose.\n\nMoral: Do not tell others how to act unless you can set a good example.</string>
    <string name="story48text">A Dog and a Cock, who were the best of friends, wished very much to see something of the world. So they decided to leave the farmyard and to set out into the world along the road that led to the woods. The two comrades traveled along in the very best of spirits and without meeting any adventure to speak of.\n\nAt nightfall the Cock, looking for a place to roost, as was his custom, spied nearby a hollow tree that he thought would do very nicely for a night\'s lodging. The Dog could creep inside and the Cock would fly up on one of the branches. So said, so done, and both slept very comfortably.\n\nWith the first glimmer of dawn the Cock awoke. For the moment he forgot just where he was. He thought he was still in the farmyard where it had been his duty to arouse the household at daybreak. So standing on tip-toes he flapped his wings and crowed lustily. But instead of awakening the farmer, he awakened a Fox not far off in the wood. The Fox immediately had rosy visions of a very delicious breakfast. Hurrying to the tree where the Cock was roosting, he said very politely:\n\n\"A hearty welcome to our woods, honored sir. I cannot tell you how glad I am to see you here. I am quite sure we shall become the closest of friends.\"\n\n\"I feel highly flattered, kind sir,\" replied the Cock slyly. \"If you will please go around to the door of my house at the foot of the tree, my porter will let you in.\"\n\nThe hungry but unsuspecting Fox, went around the tree as he was told, and in a twinkling the Dog had seized him.\n\nMoral: Those who try to deceive may expect to be paid in their own coin.</string>
    <string name="story49text">An Eagle, swooping down on powerful wings, seized a lamb in her talons and made off with it to her nest. A Jackdaw saw the deed, and his silly head was filled with the idea that he was big and strong enough to do as the Eagle had done. So with much rustling of feathers and a fierce air, he came down swiftly on the back of a large Ram. But when he tried to rise again he found that he could not get away, for his claws were tangled in the wool. And so far was he from carrying away the Ram, that the Ram hardly noticed he was there.\n\nThe Shepherd saw the fluttering Jackdaw and at once guessed what had happened. Running up, he caught the bird and clipped its wings. That evening he gave the Jackdaw to his children.\n\n\"What a funny bird this is!\" they said laughing, \"what do you call it, father?\"\n\n\"That is a Jackdaw, my children. But if you should ask him, he would say he is an Eagle.\"\n\nMoral: Do not let your vanity make you overestimate your powers.</string>
    <string name="story50text">A Boy was given permission to put his hand into a pitcher to get some filberts. But he took such a great fistful that he could not draw his hand out again. There he stood, unwilling to give up a single filbert and yet unable to get them all out at once. Vexed and disappointed he began to cry.\n\n\"My boy,\" said his mother, \"be satisfied with half the nuts you have taken and you will easily get your hand out. Then perhaps you may have some more filberts some other time.\"\n\nMoral: Do not attempt too much at once.</string>
    <string name="story51text">A Farmer was driving his wagon along a miry country road after a heavy rain. The horses could hardly drag the load through the deep mud, and at last came to a standstill when one of the wheels sank to the hub in a rut.\n\nThe farmer climbed down from his seat and stood beside the wagon looking at it but without making the least effort to get it out of the rut. All he did was to curse his bad luck and call loudly on Hercules to come to his aid. Then, it is said, Hercules really did appear, saying:\n\n\"Put your shoulder to the wheel, man, and urge on your horses. Do you think you can move the wagon by simply looking at it and whining about it? Hercules will not help unless you make some effort to help yourself.\"\n\nAnd when the farmer put his shoulder to the wheel and urged on the horses, the wagon moved very readily, and soon the Farmer was riding along in great content and with a good lesson learned.\n\nMoral: Self help is the best help. Heaven helps those who help themselves.</string>

When you are up there it is the roof that\'s talking, not you.\"\n\nMoral: Do not say anything at any time that you would not say at all times.</string>
    <string name="story53text">An Ass was being driven along a road leading down the mountain side, when he suddenly took it into his silly head to choose his own path. He could see his stall at the foot of the mountain, and to him the quickest way down seemed to be over the edge of the nearest cliff. Just as he was about to leap over, his master caught him by the tail and tried to pull him back, but the stubborn Ass would not yield and pulled with all his might.\n\n\"Very well,\" said his master, \"go your way, you willful beast, and see where it leads you.\"\n\nWith that he let go, and the foolish Ass tumbled head over heels down the mountain side.\n\nMoral: They who will not listen to reason but stubbornly go their own way against the friendly advice of those who are wiser than they, are on the road to misfortune.</string>
    <string name="story54text">A pair of Oxen were drawing a heavily loaded wagon along a miry country road. They had to use all their strength to pull the wagon, but they did not complain.\n\nThe Wheels of the wagon were of a different sort. Though the task they had to do was very light compared with that of the Oxen, they creaked and groaned at every turn. The poor Oxen, pulling with all their might to draw the wagon through the deep mud, had their ears filled with the loud complaining of the Wheels. And this, you may well know, made their work so much the harder to endure.\n\n\"Silence!\" the Oxen cried at last, out of patience. \"What have you Wheels to complain about so loudly? We are drawing all the weight, not you, and we are keeping still about it besides.\"\n\nMoral: They complain most who suffer least.</string>
    <string name="story55text">A Stork of a very simple and trusting nature had been asked by a gay party of Cranes to visit a field that had been newly planted. But the party ended dismally with all the birds entangled in the meshes of the Farmer\'s net.\n\nThe Stork begged the Farmer to spare him.\n\n\"Please let me go,\" he pleaded. \"I belong to the Stork family who you know are honest and birds of good character. Besides, I did not know the Cranes were going to steal.\"\n\n\"You may be a very good bird,\" answered the Farmer, \"but I caught you with the thieving Cranes and you will have to share the same punishment with them.\"\n\nMoral: You are judged by the company you keep.</string>
    <string name="story56text">One day a shepherd discovered a fat Pig in the meadow where his Sheep were pastured. He very quickly captured the porker, which squealed at the top of its voice the moment the Shepherd laid his hands on it. You would have thought, to hear the loud squealing, that the Pig was being cruelly hurt. But in spite of its squeals and struggles to escape, the Shepherd tucked his prize under his arm and started off to the butcher\'s in the market place.\n\nThe Sheep in the pasture were much astonished and amused at the Pig\'s behavior, and followed the Shepherd and his charge to the pasture gate.\n\n\"What makes you squeal like that?\" asked one of the Sheep. \"The Shepherd often catches and carries off one of us. But we should feel very much ashamed to make such a terrible fuss about it like you do.\"\n\n\"That is all very well,\" replied the Pig, with a squeal and a frantic kick. \"When he catches you he is only after your wool. But he wants my bacon! gree-ee-ee!\"\n\nMoral: It is easy to be brave when there is no danger.</string>
    <string name="story57text">Two men were traveling in company along the road when one of them picked up a well-filled purse.\n\n\"How lucky I am!\" he said. \"I have found a purse. Judging by its weight it must be full of gold.\"\n\n\"Do not say \'I have found a purse,\'\" said his companion. \"Say rather \'we have found a purse\' and \'how lucky we are.\' Travelers ought to share alike the fortunes or misfortunes of the road.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" replied the other angrily. \"I found it and I am going to keep it.\"\n\nJust then they heard a shout of \"Stop, thief!\" and looking around, saw a mob of people armed with clubs coming down the road.\n\nThe man who had found the purse fell into a panic.\n\n\"We are lost if they find the purse on us,\" he cried.\n\n\"No, no,\" replied the other, \"You would not say \'we\' before, so now stick to your \'I\'. Say \'I am lost.\'\"\n\nMoral: We cannot expect any one to share our misfortunes unless we are willing to share our good fortune also.</string>
    <string name="story58text">One day as the Lion walked proudly down a forest aisle, and the animals respectfully made way for him, an Ass brayed a scornful remark as he passed.\n\nThe Lion felt a flash of anger.

Ignore them.</string>
    <string name="story59text">The Frogs were tired of governing themselves. They had so much freedom that it had spoiled them, and they did nothing but sit around croaking in a bored manner and wishing for a government that could entertain them with the pomp and display of royalty, and rule them in a way to make them know they were being ruled. No milk and water government for them, they declared. So they sent a petition to Jupiter asking for a king.\n\nJupiter saw what simple and foolish creatures they were, but to keep them quiet and make them think they had a king he threw down a huge log, which fell into the water with a great splash. The Frogs hid themselves among the reeds and grasses, thinking the new king to be some fearful giant. But they soon discovered how tame and peaceable King Log was. In a short time the younger Frogs were using him for a diving platform, while the older Frogs made him a meeting place, where they complained loudly to Jupiter about the government.\n\nTo teach the Frogs a lesson the ruler of the gods now sent a Crane to be king of Frogland. The Crane proved to be a very different sort of king from old King Log. He gobbled up the poor Frogs right and left and they soon saw what fools they had been. In mournful croaks they begged Jupiter to take away the cruel tyrant before they should all be destroyed.\n\n\"How now!\" cried Jupiter \"Are you not yet content? You have what you asked for and so you have only yourselves to blame for your misfortunes.\"\n\nMoral: Be sure you can better your condition before you seek to change.</string>
    <string name="story60text">A Rat was traveling along the King\'s highway. He was a very proud Rat, considering his small size and the bad reputation all Rats have. As Mr. Rat walked along—he kept mostly to the ditch—he noticed a great commotion up the road, and soon a grand procession came in view. It was the King and his retinue.\n\nThe King rode on a huge Elephant adorned with the most gorgeous trappings. With the King in his luxurious howdah were the royal Dog and Cat. A great crowd of people followed the procession. They were so taken up with admiration of the Elephant, that the Rat was not noticed. His pride was hurt.\n\n\"What fools!\" he cried. \"Look at me, and you will soon forget that clumsy Elephant! Is it his great size that makes your eyes pop out? Or is it his wrinkled hide? Why, I have eyes and ears and as many legs as he! I am of just as much importance, and\"—\n\nBut just then the royal Cat spied him, and the next instant, the Rat knew he was not quite so important as an Elephant.\n\nMoral: A resemblance to the great in some things does not make us great.</string>
    <string name="story61text">Some Boys were playing one day at the edge of a pond in which lived a family of Frogs. The Boys amused themselves by throwing stones into the pond so as to make them skip on top of the water.\n\nThe stones were flying thick and fast and the Boys were enjoying themselves very much; but the poor Frogs in the pond were trembling with fear.\n\nAt last one of the Frogs, the oldest and bravest, put his head out of the water, and said, \"Oh, please, dear children, stop your cruel play! Though it may be fun for you, it means death to us!\"\n\nMoral: Always stop to think whether your fun may not be the cause of another\'s unhappiness.</string>
    <string name="story62text">One bright day in late autumn a family of Ants were bustling about in the warm sunshine, drying out the grain they had stored up during the summer, when a starving Grasshopper, his fiddle under his arm, came up and humbly begged for a bite to eat.\n\n\"What!\" cried the Ants in surprise, \"haven\'t you stored anything away for the winter? What in the world were you doing all last summer?\"\n\n\"I didn\'t have time to store up any food,\" whined the Grasshopper; \"I was so busy making music that before I knew it the summer was gone.\"\n\nThe Ants shrugged their shoulders in disgust.\n\n\"Making music, were you?\" they cried. \"Very well; now dance!\" And they turned their backs on the Grasshopper and went on with their work.\n\nMoral: There\'s a time for work and a time for play.</string>
    <string name="story63text">A sacred Image was being carried to the temple. It was mounted on an Ass adorned with garlands and gorgeous trappings, and a grand procession of priests and pages followed it through the streets. As the Ass walked along, the people bowed their heads reverently or fell on their knees, and the Ass thought the honor was being paid to himself.\n\nWith his head full of this foolish idea, he became so puffed up with pride and vanity that he halted and started to bray loudly. But in the midst of his song, his driver guessed what the Ass had got into his head, and began to beat him unmercifully with a stick.\n\n\"Go along with you, you stupid Ass,\" he cried. \"The honor is not meant for you but for the image you are carrying.\"\n\nMoral: Do not try to take the credit to yourself that is due to others.</string>
    <string name="story64text">A Raven, which you know is black as coal, was envious of the Swan, because her feathers were as white as the purest snow. The foolish bird got the idea that if he lived like the Swan, swimming and diving all day long and eating the weeds and plants that grow in the water, his feathers would turn white like the Swan\'s.\n\nSo he left his home in the woods and fields and flew down to live on the lakes and in the marshes. But though he washed and washed all day long, almost drowning himself at it, his feathers remained as black as ever. And as the water weeds he ate did not agree with him, he got thinner and thinner, and at last he died.\n\nMoral: A change of habits will not alter nature.</string>
    <string name="story65text">A Merchant, driving his Ass homeward from the seashore with a heavy load of salt, came to a river crossed by a shallow ford. They had crossed this river many times before without accident, but this time the Ass slipped and fell when halfway over. And when the Merchant at last got him to his feet, much of the salt had melted away. Delighted to find how much lighter his burden had become, the Ass finished the journey very gayly.\n\nNext day the Merchant went for another load of salt. On the way home the Ass, remembering what had happened at the ford, purposely let himself fall into the water, and again got rid of most of his burden.\n\nThe angry Merchant immediately turned about and drove the Ass back to the seashore, where he loaded him with two great baskets of sponges. At the ford the Ass again tumbled over; but when he had scrambled to his feet, it was a very disconsolate Ass that dragged himself homeward under a load ten times heavier than before.\n\nMoral: The same measures will not suit all circumstances.</string>
    <string name="story66text">\"Away with you, vile insect!\" said a Lion angrily to a Gnat that was buzzing around his head. But the Gnat was not in the least disturbed.\n\n\"Do you think,\" he said spitefully to the Lion, \"that I am afraid of you because they call you king?\"\n\nThe next instant he flew at the Lion and stung him sharply on the nose. Mad with rage, the Lion struck fiercely at the Gnat, but only succeeded in tearing himself with his claws. Again and again the Gnat stung the Lion, who now was roaring terribly. At last, worn out with rage and covered with wounds that his own teeth and claws had made, the Lion gave up the fight.\n\nThe Gnat buzzed away to tell the whole world about his victory, but instead he flew straight into a spider\'s web. And there, he who had defeated the King of beasts came to a miserable end, the prey of a little spider.\n\nMoral: The least of our enemies is often the most to be feared. Pride over a success should not throw us off our guard.</string>
    <string name="story67text">A certain man who visited foreign lands could talk of little when he returned to his home except the wonderful adventures he had met with and the great deeds he had done abroad.\n\nOne of the feats he told about was a leap he had made in a city Called Rhodes. That leap was so great, he said, that no other man could leap anywhere near the distance. A great many persons in Rhodes had seen him do it and would prove that what he told was true.\n\n\"No need of witnesses,\" said one of the hearers. \"Suppose this city is Rhodes.

But as for me, I would choose a single grain of barleycorn before all the jewels in the world.\"\n\nPrecious things are without value to those who cannot prize them.\n\nMoral: The least of our enemies is often the most to be feared.

    <string name="story69text">At a great celebration in honor of King Lion, the Monkey was asked to dance for the company. His dancing was very clever indeed, and the animals were all highly pleased with his grace and lightness.\n\nThe praise that was showered on the Monkey made the Camel envious. He was very sure that he could dance quite as well as the Monkey, if not better, so he pushed his way into the crowd that was gathered around the Monkey, and rising on his hind legs, began to dance. But the big hulking Camel made himself very ridiculous as he kicked out his knotty legs and twisted his long clumsy neck. Besides, the animals found it hard to keep their toes from under his heavy hoofs.\n\nAt last, when one of his huge feet came within an inch of King Lion\'s nose, the animals were so disgusted that they set upon the Camel in a rage and drove him out into the desert.\n\nShortly afterward, refreshments, consisting mostly of Camel\'s hump and ribs, were served to the company.\n\nMoral: Do not try to ape your betters.</string>
    <string name="story70text">An Ass and a Fox had become close comrades, and were constantly in each other\'s company. While the Ass cropped a fresh bit of greens, the Fox would devour a chicken from the neighboring farmyard or a bit of cheese filched from the dairy. One day the pair unexpectedly met a Lion. The Ass was very much frightened, but the Fox calmed his fears.\n\n\"I will talk to him,\" he said.\n\nSo the Fox walked boldly up to the Lion.\n\n\"Your highness,\" he said in an undertone, so the Ass could not hear him, \"I\'ve got a fine scheme in my head. If you promise not to hurt me, I will lead that foolish creature yonder into a pit where he can\'t get out, and you can feast at your pleasure.\"\n\nThe Lion agreed and the Fox returned to the Ass.\n\n\"I made him promise not to hurt us,\" said the Fox. \"But come, I know a good place to hide till he is gone.\"\n\nSo the Fox led the Ass into a deep pit. But when the Lion saw that the Ass was his for the taking, he first of all struck down the traitor Fox.\n\nMoral: Traitors may expect treachery.</string>
    <string name="story71text">The Birds and the Beasts declared war against each other. No compromise was possible, and so they went at it tooth and claw. It is said the quarrel grew out of the persecution the race of Geese suffered at the teeth of the Fox family. The Beasts, too, had cause for fight. The Eagle was constantly pouncing on the Hare, and the Owl dined daily on Mice.\n\nIt was a terrible battle. Many a Hare and many a Mouse died. Chickens and Geese fell by the score—and the victor always stopped for a feast.\n\nNow the Bat family had not openly joined either side. They were a very politic race. So when they saw the Birds getting the better of it, they were Birds for all there was in it. But when the tide of battle turned, they immediately sided with the Beasts.\n\nWhen the battle was over, the conduct of the Bats was discussed at the peace conference. Such deceit was unpardonable, and Birds and Beasts made common cause to drive out the Bats. And since then the Bat family hides in dark towers and deserted ruins, flying out only in the night.\n\nMoral: The deceitful have no friends.</string>
    <string name="story72text">Just as a great Bear rushed to seize a stray kid, a Lion leaped from another direction upon the same prey. The two fought furiously for the prize until they had received so many wounds that both sank down unable to continue the battle.\n\nJust then a Fox dashed up, and seizing the kid, made off with it as fast as he could go, while the Lion and the Bear looked on in helpless rage.\n\n\"How much better it would have been,\" they said, \"to have shared in a friendly spirit.\"\n\nMoral: Those who have all the toil do not always get the profit.</string>
    <string name="story73text">A stray Lamb stood drinking early one morning on the bank of a woodland stream. That very same morning a hungry Wolf came by farther up the stream, hunting for something to eat. He soon got his eyes on the Lamb. As a rule Mr. Wolf snapped up such delicious morsels without making any bones about it, but this Lamb looked so very helpless and innocent that the Wolf felt he ought to have some kind of an excuse for taking its life.\n\n\"How dare you paddle around in my stream and stir up all the mud!\" he shouted fiercely. \"You deserve to be punished severely for your rashness!\"\n\n\"But, your highness,\" replied the trembling Lamb, \"do not be angry! I cannot possibly muddy the water you are drinking up there. Remember, you are upstream and I am downstream.\"\n\n\"You do muddy it!\" retorted the Wolf savagely. \"And besides, I have heard that you told lies about me last year!\" \"How could I have done so?\" pleaded the Lamb. \"I wasn\'t born until this year.\"\n\n\"If it wasn\'t you, it was your brother!\"\n\n\"I have no brothers.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" snarled the Wolf, \"It was someone in your family anyway. But no matter who it was, I do not intend to be talked out of my breakfast.\"\n\nAnd without more words the Wolf seized the poor Lamb and carried her off to the forest.\n\nMoral: The tyrant can always find an excuse for his tyranny.

    <string name="story75text">Hares, as you know, are very timid. The least shadow, sends them scurrying in fright to a hiding place. Once they decided to die rather than live in such misery. But while they were debating how best to meet death, they thought they heard a noise and in a flash were scampering off to the warren. On the way they passed a pond where a family of Frogs was sitting among the reeds on the bank. In an instant the startled Frogs were seeking safety in the mud.\n\n\"Look,\" cried a Hare, \"things are not so bad after all, for here are creatures who are even afraid of us!\"\n\nMoral: However unfortunate we may think we are there is always someone worse off than ourselves.</string>
    <string name="story76text">Two Travelers were walking along the seashore. Far out they saw something riding on the waves.\n\n\"Look,\" said one, \"a great ship rides in from distant lands, bearing rich treasures!\"\n\nThe object they saw came ever nearer the shore.\n\n\"No,\" said the other, \"that is not a treasure ship. That is some fisherman\'s skiff, with the day\'s catch of savoury fish.\"\n\nStill nearer came the object. The waves washed it up on shore.\n\n\"It is a chest of gold lost from some wreck,\" they cried. Both Travelers rushed to the beach, but there they found nothing but a water-soaked log.\n\nMoral: Do not let your hopes carry you away from reality.</string>
    <string name="story77text">A Wolf had stolen a Lamb and was carrying it off to his lair to eat it. But his plans were very much changed when he met a Lion, who, without making any excuses, took the Lamb away from him.\n\nThe Wolf made off to a safe distance, and then said in a much injured tone:\n\n\"You have no right to take my property like that!\"\n\nThe Lion looked back, but as the Wolf was too far away to be taught a lesson without too much inconvenience, he said:\n\n\"Your property? Did you buy it, or did the Shepherd make you a gift of it? Pray tell me, how did you get it?\"\n\nMoral: What is evil won is evil lost.</string>
    <string name="story78text">The Peacock, they say, did not at first have the beautiful feathers in which he now takes so much pride. These, Juno, whose favorite he was, granted to him one day when he begged her for a train of feathers to distinguish him from the other birds. Then, decked in his finery, gleaming with emerald, gold, purple, and azure, he strutted proudly among the birds. All regarded him with envy. Even the most beautiful pheasant could see that his beauty was surpassed.\n\nPresently the Peacock saw an Eagle soaring high up in the blue sky and felt a desire to fly, as he had been accustomed to do. Lifting his wings he tried to rise from the ground. But the weight of his magnificent train held him down. Instead of flying up to greet the first rays of the morning sun or to bathe in the rosy light among the floating clouds at sunset, he would have to walk the ground more encumbered and oppressed than any common barnyard fowl.\n\nMoral: Do not sacrifice your freedom for the sake of pomp and show.</string>
    <string name="story79text">The Weasels and the Mice were always up in arms against each other. In every battle the Weasels carried off the victory, as well as a large number of the Mice, which they ate for dinner next day. In despair the Mice called a council, and there it was decided that the Mouse army was always beaten because it had no leaders. So a large number of generals and commanders were appointed from among the most eminent Mice.\n\nTo distinguish themselves from the soldiers in the ranks, the new leaders proudly bound on their heads lofty crests and ornaments of feathers or straw. Then after long preparation of the Mouse army in all the arts of war, they sent a challenge to the Weasels.\n\nThe Weasels accepted the challenge with eagerness, for they were always ready for a fight when a meal was in sight. They immediately attacked the Mouse army in large numbers. Soon the Mouse line gave way before the attack and the whole army fled for cover. The privates easily slipped into their holes, but the Mouse leaders could not squeeze through the narrow openings because of their head-dresses. Not one escaped the teeth of the hungry Weasels.\n\nMoral: Greatness has its penalties.</string>
    <string name="story80text">A Wolf prowling near a village one evening met a Dog. It happened to be a very lean and bony Dog, and Master Wolf would have turned up his nose at such meager fare had he not been more hungry than usual. So he began to edge toward the Dog, while the Dog backed away.\n\n\"Let me remind your lordship,\" said the Dog, his words interrupted now and then as he dodged a snap of the Wolf\'s teeth, \"how unpleasant it would be to eat me now. Look at my ribs. I am nothing but skin and bone. But let me tell you something in private. In a few days my master will give a wedding feast for his only daughter. You can guess how fine and fat I will grow on the scraps from the table. Then is the time to eat me.\"\n\nThe Wolf could not help thinking how nice it would be to have a fine fat Dog to eat instead of the scrawny object before him. So he went away pulling in his belt and promising to return.\n\nSome days later the Wolf came back for the promised feast. He found the Dog in his master\'s yard, and asked him to come out and be eaten.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the Dog, with a grin, \"I shall be delighted to have you eat me. I\'ll be out as soon as the porter opens the door.\"\n\nBut the \"porter\" was a huge Dog whom the Wolf knew by painful experience to be very unkind toward wolves. So he decided not to wait and made off as fast as his legs could carry him.\n\nMoral: Do not depend on the promises of those whose interest it is to deceive you.</string>
    <string name="story81text">A very young Fox, who had never before seen a Lion, happened to meet one in the forest. A single look was enough to send the Fox off at top speed for the nearest hiding place.\n\nThe second time the Fox saw the Lion he stopped behind a tree to look at him a moment before slinking away. But the third time, the Fox went boldly up to the Lion and, without turning a hair, said, \"Hello, there, old top.\"\n\nMoral: Familiarity breeds contempt. Acquaintance with evil blinds us to its dangers.</string>
    <string name="story82text">A Dog had learned to carry his master\'s dinner to him every day. He was very faithful to his duty, though the smell of the good things in the basket tempted him.\n\nThe Dogs in the neighborhood noticed him carrying the basket and soon discovered what was in it. They made several attempts to steal it from him. But he always guarded it faithfully.\n\nThen one day all the Dogs in the neighborhood got together and met him on his way with the basket. The Dog tried to run away from them. But at last he stopped to argue.\n\nThat was his mistake. They soon made him feel so ridiculous that he dropped the basket and seized a large piece of roast meat intended for his master\'s dinner.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said, \"you divide the rest.\"\n\nMoral: Do not stop to argue with temptation.</string>
    <string name="story83text">A Jackdaw chanced to fly over the garden of the King\'s palace. There he saw with much wonder and envy a flock of royal Peacocks in all the glory of their splendid plumage.\n\nNow the black Jackdaw was not a very handsome bird, nor very refined in manner. Yet he imagined that all he needed to make himself fit for the society of the Peacocks was a dress like theirs. So he picked up some castoff feathers of the Peacocks and stuck them among his own black plumes.\n\nDressed in his borrowed finery he strutted loftily among the birds of his own kind. Then he flew down into the garden among the Peacocks. But they soon saw who he was. Angry at the cheat, they flew at him, plucking away the borrowed feathers and also some of his own.\n\nThe poor Jackdaw returned sadly to his former companions. There another unpleasant surprise awaited him. They had not forgotten his superior airs toward them, and, to punish him, they drove him away with a rain of pecks and jeers.\n\nMoral: Borrowed feathers do not make fine birds.</string>
    <string name="story84text">It happened once upon a time that a certain Greek ship bound for Athens was wrecked off the coast close to Piraeus, the port of Athens. Had it not been for the Dolphins, who at that time were very friendly toward mankind and especially toward Athenians, all would have perished. But the Dolphins took the shipwrecked people on their backs and swam with them to shore.\n\nNow it was the custom among the Greeks to take their pet monkeys and dogs with them whenever they went on a voyage. So when one of the Dolphins saw a Monkey struggling in the water, he thought it was a man, and made the Monkey climb up on his back. Then off he swam with him toward the shore.\n\nThe Monkey sat up, grave and dignified, on the Dolphin\'s back.\n\n\"You are a citizen of illustrious Athens, are you not?\" asked the Dolphin politely.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the Monkey, proudly. \"My family is one of the noblest in the city.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said the Dolphin. \"Then of course you often visit Piraeus.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" replied the Monkey. \"Indeed, I do. I am with him constantly. Piraeus is my very best friend.\"\n\nThis answer took the Dolphin by surprise, and, turning his head, he now saw what it was he was carrying. Without more ado, he dived and left the foolish Monkey to take care of himself, while he swam off in search of some human being to save.\n\nMoral: One falsehood leads to another.</string>
    <string name="story85text">An Ass was feeding in a pasture near a wood when he saw a Wolf lurking in the shadows along the hedge. He easily guessed what the Wolf had in mind, and thought of a plan to save himself. So he pretended he was lame, and began to hobble painfully.\n\nWhen the Wolf came up, he asked the Ass what had made him lame, and the Ass replied that he had stepped on a sharp thorn.\n\n\"Please pull it out,\" he pleaded, groaning as if in pain. \"If you do not, it might stick in your throat when you eat me.\"\n\nThe Wolf saw the wisdom of the advice, for he wanted to enjoy his meal without any danger of choking. So the Ass lifted up his foot and the Wolf began to search very closely and carefully for the thorn.\n\nJust then the Ass kicked out with all his might, tumbling the Wolf a dozen paces away. And while the Wolf was getting very slowly and painfully to his feet, the Ass galloped away in safety.\n\n\"Serves me right,\" growled the Wolf as he crept into the bushes. \"I\'m a butcher by trade, not a doctor.\"\n\nMoral: Stick to your trade.</string>
    <string name="story86text">Once upon a time a Cat and a Monkey lived as pets in the same house. They were great friends and were constantly in all sorts of mischief together. What they seemed to think of more than anything else was to get something to eat, and it did not matter much to them how they got it.\n\nOne day they were sitting by the fire, watching some chestnuts roasting on the hearth. How to get them was the question.\n\n\"I would gladly get them,\" said the cunning Monkey, \"but you are much more skillful at such things than I am. Pull them out and I\'ll divide them between us.\"\n\nPussy stretched out her paw very carefully, pushed aside some of the cinders, and drew back her paw very quickly. Then she tried it again, this time pulling a chestnut half out of the fire. A third time and she drew out the chestnut. This performance she went through several times, each time singeing her paw severely. As fast as she pulled the chestnuts out of the fire, the Monkey ate them up.\n\nNow the master came in, and away scampered the rascals, Mistress Cat with a burnt paw and no chestnuts. From that time on, they say, she contented herself with mice and rats and had little to do with Sir Monkey.\n\nThe flatterer seeks some benefit at your expense.</string>
    <string name="story87text">Some Dogs found the skin of a Lion and furiously began to tear it with their teeth. A Fox chanced to see them and laughed scornfully.\n\n\"If that Lion had been alive,\" he said, \"it would have been a very different story. He would have made you feel how much sharper his claws are than your teeth.\"\n\nMoral: It is easy and also contemptible to kick a man that is down.</string>
    <string name="story88text">Some hungry Dogs saw a number of hides at the bottom of a stream where the Tanner had put them to soak. A fine hide makes an excellent meal for a hungry Dog, but the water was deep and the Dogs could not reach the hides from the bank. So they held a council and decided that the very best thing to do was to drink up the river.\n\nAll fell to lapping up the water as fast as they could. But though they drank and drank until, one after another, all of them had burst with drinking, still, for all their effort, the water in the river remained as high as ever.\n\nMoral: Do not try to do impossible things.</string>
    <string name="story89text">A Rabbit left his home one day for a dinner of clover. But he forgot to latch the door of his house and while he was gone a Weasel walked in and calmly made himself at home. When the Rabbit returned, there was the Weasel\'s nose sticking out of the Rabbit\'s own doorway, sniffing the fine air.\n\nThe Rabbit was quite angry—for a Rabbit—, and requested the Weasel to move out. But the Weasel was perfectly content. He was settled down for good.\n\nA wise old Cat heard the dispute and offered to settle it.\n\n\"Come close to me,\" said the Cat, \"I am very deaf. Put your mouths close to my ears while you tell me the facts.\"\n\nThe unsuspecting pair did as they were told and in an instant the Cat had them both under her claws. No one could deny that the dispute had been definitely settled.\n\nMoral: The strong are apt to settle questions to their own advantage.</string>
    <string name="story90text">A Bear roaming the woods in search of berries happened on a fallen tree in which a swarm of Bees had stored their honey. The Bear began to nose around the log very carefully to find out if the Bees were at home. Just then one of the swarm came home from the clover field with a load of sweets. Guessing what the Bear was after, the Bee flew at him, stung him sharply and then disappeared into the hollow log.\n\nThe Bear lost his temper in an instant, and sprang upon the log tooth and claw, to destroy the nest. But this only brought out the whole swarm. The poor Bear had to take to his heels, and he was able to save himself only by diving into a pool of water.\n\nMoral: It is wiser to bear a single injury in silence than to provoke a thousand by flying into a rage.</string>
    <string name="story91text">A Dog asleep in a manger filled with hay, was awakened by the Cattle, which came in tired and hungry from working in the field. But the Dog would not let them get near the manger, and snarled and snapped as if it were filled with the best of meat and bones, all for himself.\n\nThe Cattle looked at the Dog in disgust. \"How selfish he is!\" said one. \"He cannot eat the hay and yet he will not let us eat it who are so hungry for it!\"\n\nNow the farmer came in. When he saw how the Dog was acting, he seized a stick and drove him out of the stable with many a blow for his selfish behavior.\n\nMoral: Do not grudge others what you cannot enjoy yourself.</string>
    <string name="story92text">A hungry Wolf spied a Goat browsing at the top of a steep cliff where he could not possibly get at her.\n\n\"That is a very dangerous place for you,\" he called out, pretending to be very anxious about the Goat\'s safety. \"What if you should fall! Please listen to me and come down! Here you can get all you want of the finest, tenderest grass in the country.\"\n\nThe Goat looked over the edge of the cliff.\n\n\"How very, very anxious you are about me,\" she said, \"and how generous you are with your grass! But I know you! It\'s your own appetite you are thinking of, not mine!\"\n\nMoral: An invitation prompted by selfishness is not to be accepted.</string>
    <string name="story93text">One day as an Ass was walking in the pasture, he found some Grasshoppers chirping merrily in a grassy corner of the field.\n\nHe listened with a great deal of admiration to the song of the Grasshoppers. It was such a joyful song that his pleasure-loving heart was filled with a wish to sing as they did.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked very respectfully, \"that has given you such beautiful voices? Is there any special food you eat, or is it some divine nectar that makes you sing so wonderfully?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Grasshoppers, who were very fond of a joke; \"it is the dew we drink! Try some and see.\"\n\nSo thereafter the Ass would eat nothing and drink nothing but dew.\n\nNaturally, the poor foolish Ass soon died.\n\nMoral: The laws of nature are unchangeable.</string>
    <string name="story94text">A Mule had had a long rest and much good feeding. He was feeling very vigorous indeed, and pranced around loftily, holding his head high.\n\n\"My father certainly was a full-blooded racer,\" he said. \"I can feel that distinctly.\"\n\nNext day he was put into harness again and that evening he was very downhearted indeed.\n\n\"I was mistaken,\" he said. \"My father was an Ass after all.\"\n\nMoral: Be sure of your pedigree before you boast of it.</string>
    <string name="story95text">A very young Mouse, who had never seen anything of the world, almost came to grief the very first time he ventured out. And this is the story he told his mother about his adventures.\n\n\"I was strolling along very peaceably when, just as I turned the corner into the next yard, I saw two strange creatures. One of them had a very kind and gracious look, but the other was the most fearful monster you can imagine. You should have seen him.\n\n\"On top of his head and in front of his neck hung pieces of raw red meat. He walked about restlessly, tearing up the ground with his toes, and beating his arms savagely against his sides. The moment he caught sight of me he opened his pointed mouth as if to swallow me, and then he let out a piercing roar that frightened me almost to death.\"\n\nCan you guess who it was that our young Mouse was trying to describe to his mother? It was nobody but the Barnyard Cock and the first one the little Mouse had ever seen.\n\n\"If it had not been for that terrible monster,\" the Mouse went on, \"I should have made the acquaintance of the pretty creature, who looked so good and gentle. He had thick, velvety fur, a meek face, and a look that was very modest, though his eyes were bright and shining. As he looked at me he waved his fine long tail and smiled.\n\n\"I am sure he was just about to speak to me when the monster I have told you about let out a screaming yell, and I ran for my life.\"\n\n\"My son,\" said the Mother Mouse, \"that gentle creature you saw was none other than the Cat. Under his kindly appearance, he bears a grudge against every one of us. The other was nothing but a bird who wouldn\'t harm you in the least. As for the Cat, he eats us. So be thankful, my child, that you escaped with your life, and, as long as you live, never judge people by their looks.\"\n\nMoral: Do not trust alone to outward appearances.</string>
    <string name="story96text">A Wolf had been prowling around a flock of Sheep for a long time, and the Shepherd watched very anxiously to prevent him from carrying off a Lamb. But the Wolf did not try to do any harm. Instead he seemed to be helping the Shepherd take care of the Sheep. At last the Shepherd got so used to seeing the Wolf about that he forgot how wicked he could be.\n\nOne day he even went so far as to leave his flock in the Wolf\'s care while he went on an errand. But when he came back and saw how many of the flock had been killed and carried off, he knew how foolish to trust a Wolf.\n\nMoral: Once a wolf, always a wolf.</string>
    <string name="story97text">A Peacock, puffed up with vanity, met a Crane one day, and to impress him spread his gorgeous tail in the Sun.\n\n\"Look,\" he said. \"What have you to compare with this? I am dressed in all the glory of the rainbow, while your feathers are gray as dust!\"\n\nThe Crane spread his broad wings and flew up toward the sun.\n\n\"Follow me if you can,\" he said. But the Peacock stood where he was among the birds of the barnyard, while the Crane soared in freedom far up into the blue sky.\n\nMoral: The useful is of much more importance and value, than the ornamental.</string>
    <string name="story98text">Some Cranes saw a farmer plowing a large field. When the work of plowing was done, they patiently watched him sow the seed. It was their feast, they thought.\n\nSo, as soon as the Farmer had finished planting and had gone home, down they flew to the field, and began to eat as fast as they could.\n\nThe Farmer, of course, knew the Cranes and their ways. He had had experience with such birds before. He soon returned to the field with a sling. But he did not bring any stones with him. He expected to scare the Cranes just by swinging the sling in the air, and shouting loudly at them.\n\nAt first the Cranes flew away in great terror. But they soon began to see that none of them ever got hurt. They did not even hear the noise of stones whizzing through the air, and as for words, they would kill nobody. At last they paid no attention whatever to the Farmer.\n\nThe Farmer saw that he would have to take other measures. He wanted to save at least some of his grain. So he loaded his sling with stones and killed several of the Cranes. This had the effect the Farmer wanted, for from that day the Cranes visited his field no more.\n\nMoral: Bluff and threatening words are of little value with rascals. Bluff is no proof that hard fists are lacking.</string>
    <string name="story99text">A rich old farmer, who felt that he had not many more days to live, called his sons to his bedside.\n\n\"My sons,\" he said, \"heed what I have to say to you. Do not on any account part with the estate that has belonged to our family for so many generations. Somewhere on it is hidden a rich treasure. I do not know the exact spot, but it is there, and you will surely find it. Spare no energy and leave no spot unturned in your search.\"\n\nThe father died, and no sooner was he in his grave than the sons set to work digging with all their might, turning up every foot of ground with their spades, and going over the whole farm two or three times.\n\nNo hidden gold did they find; but at harvest time when they had settled their accounts and had pocketed a rich profit far greater than that of any of their neighbors, they understood that the treasure their father had told them about was the wealth of a bountiful crop, and that in their industry had they found the treasure.\n\nMoral: Industry is itself a treasure.</string>
    <string name="story100text">Two Pots, one of brass and the other of clay, stood together on the hearthstone. One day the Brass Pot proposed to the Earthen Pot that they go out into the world together. But the Earthen Pot excused himself, saying that it would be wiser for him to stay in the corner by the fire.\n\n\"It would take so little to break me,\" he said. \"You know how fragile I am. The least shock is sure to shatter me!\"\n\n\"Don\'t let that keep you at home,\" urged the Brass Pot. \"I shall take very good care of you. If we should happen to meet anything hard I will step between and save you.\"\n\nSo the Earthen Pot at last consented, and the two set out side by side, jolting along on three stubby legs first to this side, then to that, and bumping into each other at every step.\n\nThe Earthen Pot could not survive that sort of companionship very long. They had not gone ten paces before the Earthen Pot cracked, and at the next jolt he flew into a thousand pieces.\n\nMoral: Equals make the best friends.</string>
    <string name="story101text">There was once a Countryman who possessed the most wonderful Goose you can imagine, for every day when he visited the nest, the Goose had laid a beautiful, glittering, golden egg.\n\nThe Countryman took the eggs to market and soon began to get rich. But it was not long before he grew impatient with the Goose because she gave him only a single golden egg a day. He was not getting rich fast enough.\n\nThen one day, after he had finished counting his money, the idea came to him that he could get all the golden eggs at once by killing the Goose and cutting it open. But when the deed was done, not a single golden egg did he find, and his precious Goose was dead.\n\nMoral: Those who have plenty want more and so lose all they have.</string>
    <string name="story102text">Two Bulls were fighting furiously in a field, at one side of which was a marsh. An old Frog living in the marsh, trembled as he watched the fierce battle.\n\n\"What are you afraid of?\" asked a young Frog.\n\n\"Do you not see,\" replied the old Frog, \"that the Bull who is beaten, will be driven away from the good forage up there to the reeds of this marsh, and we shall all be trampled into the mud?\"\n\nIt turned out as the Frog had said.

    <string name="story103text">A little hungry Mouse found his way one day into a basket of corn. He had to squeeze himself a good deal to get through the narrow opening between the strips of the basket. But the corn was tempting and the Mouse was determined to get in. When at last he had succeeded, he gorged himself to bursting. Indeed he he became about three times as big around the middle as he was when he went in.\n\nAt last he felt satisfied and dragged himself to the opening to get out again. But the best he could do was to get his head out. So there he sat groaning and moaning, both from the discomfort inside him and his anxiety to escape from the basket.\n\nJust then a Weasel came by. He understood the situation quickly.\n\n\"My friend,\" he said, \"I know what you\'ve been doing. You\'ve been stuffing. That\'s what you get. You will have to stay there till you feel just like you did when you went in.

    <string name="story104text">A Farmer walked through his field one cold winter morning. On the ground lay a Snake, stiff and frozen with the cold. The Farmer knew how deadly the Snake could be, and yet he picked it up and put it in his bosom to warm it back to life.\n\nThe Snake soon revived, and when it had enough strength, bit the man who had been so kind to it. The bite was deadly and the Farmer felt that he must die. As he drew his last breath, he said to those standing around:\n\nMoral: Learn from my fate not to take pity on a scoundrel.</string>
    <string name="story105text">A Stag had fallen sick. He had just strength enough to gather some food and find a quiet clearing in the woods, where he lay down to wait until his strength should return. The Animals heard about the Stag\'s illness and came to ask after his health. Of course, they were all hungry, and helped themselves freely to the Stag\'s food; and as you would expect, the Stag soon starved to death.\n\nMoral: Good will is worth nothing unless it is accompanied by good acts.</string>
    <string name="story106text">One cold stormy day a Goatherd drove his Goats for shelter into a cave, where a number of Wild Goats had also found their way. The Shepherd wanted to make the Wild Goats part of his flock; so he fed them well. But to his own flock, he gave only just enough food to keep them alive. When the weather cleared, and the Shepherd led the Goats out to feed, the Wild Goats scampered off to the hills.\n\n\"Is that the thanks I get for feeding you and treating you so well?\" complained the Shepherd.\n\n\"Do not expect us to join your flock,\" replied one of the Wild Goats. \"We know how you would treat us later on, if some strangers should come as we did.\"\n\nMoral: It is unwise to treat old friends badly for the sake of new ones.</string>
    <string name="story107text">A young fellow, who was very popular among his boon companions as a good spender, quickly wasted his fortune trying to live up to his reputation. Then one fine day in early spring he found himself with not a penny left, and no property save the clothes he wore.\n\nHe was to meet some jolly young men that morning, and he was at his wits\' end how to get enough money to keep up appearances. Just then a Swallow flew by, twittering merrily, and the young man, thinking summer had come, hastened off to a clothes dealer, to whom he sold all the clothes he wore down to his very tunic.\n\nA few days later a change in weather brought a severe frost; and the poor swallow and that foolish young man in his light tunic, and with his arms and knees bare, could scarcely keep life in their shivering bodies.\n\nMoral: One swallow does not make a summer.</string>
    <string name="story108text">A Cat was growing very thin. As you have guessed, he did not get enough to eat. One day he heard that some Birds in the neighborhood were ailing and needed a doctor. So he put on a pair of spectacles, and with a leather box in his hand, knocked at the door of the Bird\'s home.\n\nThe Birds peeped out, and Dr. Cat, with much solicitude, asked how they were. He would be very happy to give them some medicine.\n\n\"Tweet, tweet,\" laughed the Birds. \"Very smart, aren\'t you? We are very well, thank you, and more so, if you only keep away from here.\"\n\nMoral: Be wise and shun the quack.</string>

    <string name="story110text">A man who lived a long time ago believed that he could read the future in the stars. He called himself an Astrologer, and spent his time at night gazing at the sky.\n\nOne evening he was walking along the open road outside the village. His eyes were fixed on the stars. He thought he saw there that the end of the world was at hand, when all at once, down he went into a hole full of mud and water.\n\nThere he stood up to his ears, in the muddy water, and madly clawing at the slippery sides of the hole in his effort to climb out.\n\nHis cries for help soon brought the villagers running. As they pulled him out of the mud, one of them said:\n\n\"You pretend to read the future in the stars, and yet you fail to see what is at your feet!

He had tried to attack them several times, but they had kept together, and helped each other to drive him off. The Lion had little hope of eating them, for he was no match for three strong Bullocks with their sharp horns and hoofs. But he could not keep away from that field, for it is hard to resist watching a good meal, even when there is little chance of getting it.\n\nThen one day the Bullocks had a quarrel, and when the hungry Lion came to look at them and lick his chops as he was accustomed to do, he found them in separate corners of the field, as far away from one another as they could get.\n\nIt was now an easy matter for the Lion to attack them one at a time, and this he proceeded to do with the greatest satisfaction and relish.\n\nMoral: In unity is strength.</string>
    <string name="story112text">A poor Woodman was cutting down a tree near the edge of a deep pool in the forest. It was late in the day and the Woodman was tired. He had been working since sunrise and his strokes were not so sure as they had been early that morning. Thus it happened that the axe slipped and flew out of his hands into the pool.\n\nThe Woodman was in despair. The axe was all he possessed with which to make a living, and he had not money enough to buy a new one. As he stood wringing his hands and weeping, the god Mercury suddenly appeared and asked what the trouble was. The Woodman told what had happened, and straightway the kind Mercury dived into the pool. When he came up again he held a wonderful golden axe.\n\n\"Is this your axe?\" Mercury asked the Woodman.\n\n\"No,\" answered the honest Woodman, \"that is not my axe.\"\n\nMercury laid the golden axe on the bank and sprang back into the pool. This time he brought up an axe of silver, but the Woodman declared again that his axe was just an ordinary one with a wooden handle.\n\nMercury dived down for the third time, and when he came up again he had the very axe that had been lost.\n\nThe poor Woodman was very glad that his axe had been found and could not thank the kind god enough. Mercury was greatly pleased with the Woodman\'s honesty.\n\n\"I admire your honesty,\" he said, \"and as a reward you may have all three axes, the gold and the silver as well as your own.\"\n\nThe happy Woodman returned to his home with his treasures, and soon the story of his good fortune was known to everybody in the village. Now there were several Woodmen in the village who believed that they could easily win the same good fortune. They hurried out into the woods, one here, one there, and hiding their axes in the bushes, pretended they had lost them. Then they wept and wailed and called on Mercury to help them.\n\nAnd indeed, Mercury did appear, first to this one, then to that. To each one he showed an axe of gold, and each one eagerly claimed it to be the one he had lost. But Mercury did not give them the golden axe. Oh no! Instead he gave them each a hard whack over the head with it and sent them home. And when they returned next day to look for their own axes, they were nowhere to be found.\n\nMoral: Honesty is the best policy.</string>
    <string name="story113text">A Crab one day grew disgusted with the sands in which he lived. He decided to take a stroll to the meadow not far inland. There he would find better fare than briny water and sand mites. So off he crawled to the meadow. But there a hungry Fox spied him, and in a twinkling, ate him up, both shell and claw.\n\nMoral: Be content with your lot.</string>
    <string name="story114text">A Serpent had succeeded in surprising an Eagle and had wrapped himself around the Eagle\'s neck. The Eagle could not reach the Serpent, neither with beak nor claws. Far into the sky he soared trying to shake off his enemy. But the Serpent\'s hold only tightened, and slowly the Eagle sank back to earth, gasping for breath.\n\nA Countryman chanced to see the unequal combat. In pity for the noble Eagle he rushed up and soon had loosened the coiling Serpent and freed the Eagle.\n\nThe Serpent was furious. He had no chance to bite the watchful Countryman. Instead he struck at the drinking horn, hanging at the Countryman\'s belt, and into it let fly the poison of his fangs.\n\nThe Countryman now went on toward home. Becoming thirsty on the way, he filled his horn at a spring, and was about to drink. There was a sudden rush of great wings. Sweeping down, the Eagle seized the poisoned horn from out his savior\'s hands, and flew away with it to hide it where it could never be found.\n\nMoral: An act of kindness is well repaid.</string>
    <string name="story115text">A Bull once escaped from a Lion by entering a cave which the Goatherds used to house their flocks in stormy weather and at night. It happened that one of the Goats had been left behind, and the Bull had no sooner got inside than this Goat lowered his head and made a rush at him, butting him with his horns. As the Lion was still prowling outside the entrance to the cave, the Bull had to submit to the insult.\n\n\"Do not think,\" he said, \"that I submit to your cowardly treatment because I am afraid of you. When that Lion leaves, I\'ll teach you a lesson you won\'t forget.\"\n\nMoral: It is wicked to take advantage of another\'s distress.</string>
    <string name="story116text">An old Lion, whose teeth and claws were so worn that it was not so easy for him to get food as in his younger days, pretended that he was sick. He took care to let all his neighbors know about it, and then lay down in his cave to wait for visitors. And when they came to offer him their sympathy, he ate them up one by one.\n\nThe Fox came too, but he was very cautious about it. Standing at a safe distance from the cave, he inquired politely after the Lion\'s health. The Lion replied that he was very ill indeed, and asked the Fox to step in for a moment. But Master Fox very wisely stayed outside, thanking the Lion very kindly for the invitation.\n\n\"I should be glad to do as you ask,\" he added, \"but I have noticed that there are many footprints leading into your cave and none coming out. Pray tell me, how do your visitors find their way out again?\"\n\nMoral: Take warning from the misfortunes of others.</string>
    <string name="story117text">A Lion and a Man chanced to travel in company through the forest. They soon began to quarrel, for each of them boasted that he and his kind were far superior to the other both in strength and mind.\n\nNow they reached a clearing in the forest and there stood a statue. It was a representation of Heracles in the act of tearing the jaws of the Nemean Lion.\n\n\"See,\" said the man, \"that\'s how strong we are! The King of Beasts is like wax in our hands!\"\n\n\"Ho!\" laughed the Lion, \"a Man made that statue. It would have been quite a different scene had a Lion made it!\"\n\nMoral: It all depends on the point of view, and who tells the story.</string>
    <string name="story118text">There was once an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog. This Dog was a favorite and received many a pat and kind word from his Master, as well as choice bits from his plate. Every day the Dog would run to meet the Master, frisking playfully about and leaping up to lick his hands and face.\n\nAll this the Ass saw with much discontent. Though he was well fed, he had much work to do; besides, the Master hardly ever took any notice of him.\n\nNow the jealous Ass got it into his silly head that all he had to do to win his Master\'s favor was to act like the Dog. So one day he left his stable and clattered eagerly into the house.\n\nFinding his Master seated at the dinner table, he kicked up his heels and, with a loud bray, pranced giddily around the table, upsetting it as he did so. Then he planted his forefeet on his Master\'s knees and rolled out his tongue to lick the Master\'s face, as he had seen the Dog do. But his weight upset the chair, and Ass and man rolled over together in the pile of broken dishes from the table.\n\nThe Master was much alarmed at the strange behavior of the Ass, and calling for help, soon attracted the attention of the servants. When they saw the danger the Master was in from the clumsy beast, they set upon the Ass and drove him with kicks and blows back to the stable. There they left him to mourn the foolishness that had brought him nothing but a sound beating.\n\nMoral: Behavior that is regarded as agreeable in one is very rude and impertinent in another.\nDo not try to gain favor by acting in a way that is contrary to your own nature and character.</string>
    <string name="story119text">A Milkmaid had been out to milk the cows and was returning from the field with the shining milk pail balanced nicely on her head. As she walked along, her pretty head was busy with plans for the days to come.\n\n\"This good, rich milk,\" she mused, \"will give me plenty of cream to churn. The butter I make I will take to market, and with the money I get for it I will buy a lot of eggs for hatching. How nice it will be when they are all hatched and the yard is full of fine young chicks. Then when May day comes I will sell them, and with the money I\'ll buy a lovely new dress to wear to the fair. All the young men will look at me. They will come and try to make love to me,—but I shall very quickly send them about their business!\"\n\nAs she thought of how she would settle that matter, she tossed her head scornfully, and down fell the pail of milk to the ground. And all the milk flowed out, and with it vanished butter and eggs and chicks and new dress and all the milkmaid\'s pride.\n\nMoral: Do not count your chickens before they are hatched.</string>
    <string name="story120text">A Wolf, lurking near the Shepherd\'s hut, saw the Shepherd and his family feasting on a roasted lamb.\n\n\"Aha!\" he muttered. \"What a great shouting and running about would there have been, had they caught me at just the very thing they are doing with so much enjoyment!\"\n\nMoral: Men often condemn others for what they see no wrong in doing themselves.</string>
    <string name="story121text">A Goat strayed away from the flock, tempted by a patch of clover. The Goatherd tried to call it back, but in vain. It would not obey him. Then he picked up a stone and threw it, breaking the Goat\'s horn.\n\nThe Goatherd was frightened.\n\n\"Do not tell the master,\" he begged the Goat.\n\n\"No,\" said the Goat, \"that broken horn can speak for itself!\"\n\nMoral: Wicked deeds will not stay hid.</string>
    <string name="story122text">A Miser had buried his gold in a secret place in his garden. Every day he went to the spot, dug up the treasure and counted it piece by piece to make sure it was all there. He made so many trips that a Thief, who had been observing him, guessed what it was the Miser had hidden, and one night quietly dug up the treasure and made off with it.\n\nWhen the Miser discovered his loss, he was overcome with grief and despair. He groaned and cried and tore his hair.\n\nA passerby heard his cries and asked what had happened.\n\n\"My gold! O my gold!\" cried the Miser, wildly, \"someone has robbed me!\"\n\n\"Your gold! There in that hole? Why did you put it there? Why did you not keep it in the house where you could easily get it when you had to buy things?\"\n\n\"Buy!\" screamed the Miser angrily. \"Why, I never touched the gold. I couldn\'t think of spending any of it.\"\n\nThe stranger picked up a large stone and threw it into the hole.\n\n\"If that is the case,\" he said, \"cover up that stone. It is worth just as much to you as the treasure you lost!\"\n\nMoral: A possession is worth no more than the use we make of it.</string>
    <string name="story123text">There was once a Wolf who got very little to eat because the Dogs of the village were so wide awake and watchful. He was really nothing but skin and bones, and it made him very downhearted to think of it.\n\nOne night this Wolf happened to fall in with a fine fat House Dog who had wandered a little too far from home. The Wolf would gladly have eaten him then and there, but the House Dog looked strong enough to leave his marks should he try it. So the Wolf spoke very humbly to the Dog, complimenting him on his fine appearance.\n\n\"You can be as well-fed as I am if you want to,\" replied the Dog. \"Leave the woods; there you live miserably. Why, you have to fight hard for every bite you get. Follow my example and you will get along beautifully.\"\n\n\"What must I do?\" asked the Wolf.\n\n\"Hardly anything,\" answered the House Dog. \"Chase people who carry canes, bark at beggars, and fawn on the people of the house. In return you will get tidbits of every kind, chicken bones, choice bits of meat, sugar, cake, and much more beside, not to speak of kind words and caresses.\"\n\nThe Wolf had such a beautiful vision of his coming happiness that he almost wept. But just then he noticed that the hair on the Dog\'s neck was worn and the skin was chafed.\n\n\"What is that on your neck?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all,\" replied the Dog.\n\n\"What! nothing!\"\n\n\"Oh, just a trifle!\"\n\n\"But please tell me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you see the mark of the collar to which my chain is fastened.\"\n\n\"What! A chain!\" cried the Wolf. \"Don\'t you go wherever you please?\"\n\n\"Not always! But what\'s the difference?\" replied the Dog.\n\n\"All the difference in the world! I don\'t care a rap for your feasts and I wouldn\'t take all the tender young lambs in the world at that price.\" And away ran the Wolf to the woods.\n\nMoral: There is nothing worth so much as liberty</string>
    <string name="story124text">A Fox, swimming across a river, was barely able to reach the bank, where he lay bruised and exhausted from his struggle with the swift current. Soon a swarm of blood-sucking flies settled on him; but he lay quietly, still too weak to run away from them.\n\nA Hedgehog happened by. \"Let me drive the flies away,\" he said kindly.\n\n\"No, no!\" exclaimed the Fox, \"do not disturb them! They have taken all they can hold. If you drive them away, another greedy swarm will come and take the little blood I have left.\"\n\nMoral: Better to bear a lesser evil than to risk a greater in removing it.</string>
    <string name="story125text">A Bat blundered into the nest of a Weasel, who ran up to catch and eat him. The Bat begged for his life, but the Weasel would not listen.\n\n\"You are a Mouse,\" he said, \"and I am a sworn enemy of Mice. Every Mouse I catch, I am going to eat!\"\n\n\"But I am not a Mouse!\" cried the Bat. \"Look at my wings. Can Mice fly? Why, I am only a Bird! Please let me go!\"\n\nThe Weasel had to admit that the Bat was not a Mouse, so he let him go. But a few days later, the foolish Bat went blindly into the nest of another Weasel. This Weasel happened to be a bitter enemy of Birds, and he soon had the Bat under his claws, ready to eat him.\n\n\"You are a Bird,\" he said, \"and I am going to eat you!\"\n\n\"What,\" cried the Bat, \"I, a Bird! Why, all Birds have feathers! I am nothing but a Mouse. \'Down with all Cats,\' is my motto!\"\n\nAnd so the Bat escaped with his life a second time.\n\nMoral: Set your sails with the wind.</string>
    <string name="story126text">An old Toad once informed all his neighbors that he was a learned doctor. In fact he could cure anything. The Fox heard the news and hurried to see the Toad. He looked the Toad over very carefully.\n\n\"Mr. Toad,\" he said, \"I\'ve been told that you cure anything! But just take a look at yourself, and then try some of your own medicine. If you can cure yourself of that blotchy skin and that rheumatic gait, someone might believe you. Otherwise, I should advise you to try some other profession.\"\n\nMoral: Those who would mend others, should first mend themselves.</string>
    <string name="story127text">A Fox that had been caught in a trap, succeeded at last, after much painful tugging, in getting away. But he had to leave his beautiful bushy tail behind him.\n\nFor a long time he kept away from the other Foxes, for he knew well enough that they would all make fun of him and crack jokes and laugh behind his back. But it was hard for him to live alone, and at last he thought of a plan that would perhaps help him out of his trouble.\n\nHe called a meeting of all the Foxes, saying that he had something of great importance to tell the tribe.\n\nWhen they were all gathered together, the Fox Without a Tail got up and made a long speech about those Foxes who had come to harm because of their tails.\n\nThis one had been caught by hounds when his tail had become entangled in the hedge. That one had not been able to run fast enough because of the weight of his brush. Besides, it was well known, he said, that men hunt Foxes simply for their tails, which they cut off as prizes of the hunt. With such proof of the danger and uselessness of having a tail, said Master Fox, he would advise every Fox to cut it off, if he valued life and safety.\n\nWhen he had finished talking, an old Fox arose, and said, smiling:\n\n\"Master Fox, kindly turn around for a moment, and you shall have your answer.\"\n\nWhen the poor Fox Without a Tail turned around, there arose such a storm of jeers and hooting, that he saw how useless it was to try any longer to persuade the Foxes to part with their tails.\n\nMoral: Do not listen to the advice of him who seeks to lower you to his own level.</string>
    <string name="story128text">There was once a Dog who was so ill-natured and mischievous that his Master had to fasten a heavy wooden clog about his neck to keep him from annoying visitors and neighbors. But the Dog seemed to be very proud of the clog and dragged it about noisily as if he wished to attract everybody\'s attention. He was not able to impress anyone.\n\n\"You would be wiser,\" said an old acquaintance, \"to keep quietly out of sight with that clog. Do you want everybody to know what a disgraceful and ill-natured Dog you are?\"\n\nMoral: Notoriety is not fame.</string>
    <string name="story129text">A Butterfly once fell in love with a beautiful Rose. The Rose was not indifferent, for the Butterfly\'s wings were powdered in a charming pattern of gold and silver. And so, when he fluttered near and told how he loved her, she blushed rosily and said yes. After much pretty love-making and many whispered vows of constancy, the Butterfly took a tender leave of his sweetheart.\n\nBut alas! It was a long time before he came back to her.\n\n\"Is this your constancy?\" she exclaimed tearfully. \"It is ages since you went away, and all the time, you have been carrying on with all sorts of flowers. I saw you kiss Miss Geranium, and you fluttered around Miss Mignonette until Honey Bee chased you away. I wish he had stung you!\"\n\n\"Constancy!\" laughed the Butterfly. \"I had no sooner left you than I saw Zephyr kissing you. You carried on scandalously with Mr. Bumble Bee and you made eyes at every single Bug you could see. You can\'t expect any constancy from me!\"\n\nMoral: Do not expect constancy in others if you have none yourself.</string>
    <string name="story130text">Once a Cat and a Fox were traveling together. As they went along, picking up provisions on the way—a stray mouse here, a fat chicken there—they began an argument to while away the time between bites. And, as usually happens when comrades argue, the talk began to get personal.\n\n\"You think you are extremely clever, don\'t you?\" said the Fox. \"Do you pretend to know more than I? Why, I know a whole sackful of tricks!\"\n\n\"Well,\" retorted the Cat, \"I admit I know one trick only, but that one, let me tell you, is worth a thousand of yours!\"\n\nJust then, close by, they heard a hunter\'s horn and the yelping of a pack of hounds. In an instant the Cat was up a tree, hiding among the leaves.\n\n\"This is my trick,\" he called to the Fox. \"Now let me see what yours are worth.\"\n\nBut the Fox had so many plans for escape he could not decide which one to try first. He dodged here and there with the hounds at his heels. He doubled on his tracks, he ran at top speed, he entered a dozen burrows,—but all in vain. The hounds caught him, and soon put an end to the boaster and all his tricks.\n\nMoral: Common sense is always worth more than cunning.</string>
    <string name="story131text">A Boy, stung by a Nettle, ran home crying, to get his mother to blow on the hurt and kiss it.\n\n\"Son,\" said the Boy\'s mother, when she had comforted him, \"the next time you come near a Nettle, grasp it firmly, and it will be as soft as silk.\"\n\nMoral: Whatever you do, do with all your might.</string>
    <string name="story132text">A Lion had grown very old. His teeth were worn away. His limbs could no longer bear him, and the King of Beasts was very pitiful indeed as he lay gasping on the ground, about to die.\n\nWhere now his strength and his former graceful beauty?\n\nNow a Boar spied him, and rushing at him, gored him with his yellow tusk. A Bull trampled him with his heavy hoofs. Even a contemptible Ass let fly his heels and brayed his insults in the face of the Lion.\n\nMoral: It is cowardly to attack the defenseless, though he be an enemy.</string>
    <string name="story133text">One moonlight evening as Master Fox was taking his usual stroll in the woods, he saw a number of Pheasants perched quite out of his reach on a limb of a tall old tree. The sly Fox soon found a bright patch of moonlight, where the Pheasants could see him clearly; there he raised himself up on his hind legs, and began a wild dance. First he whirled \'round and \'round like a top, then he hopped up and down, cutting all sorts of strange capers. The Pheasants stared giddily. They hardly dared blink for fear of losing him out of their sight a single instant.\n\nNow the Fox made as if to climb a tree, now he fell over and lay still, playing dead, and the next instant he was hopping on all fours, his back in the air, and his bushy tail shaking so that it seemed to throw out silver sparks in the moonlight.\n\nBy this time the poor birds\' heads were in a whirl. And when the Fox began his performance all over again, so dazed did they become, that they lost their hold on the limb, and fell down one by one to the Fox.\n\nMoral: Too much attention to danger may cause us to fall victims to it.</string>
    <string name="story134text">Two Men were traveling in company through a forest, when, all at once, a huge Bear crashed out of the brush near them.\n\nOne of the Men, thinking of his own safety, climbed a tree.\n\nThe other, unable to fight the savage beast alone, threw himself on the ground and lay still, as if he were dead. He had heard that a Bear will not touch a dead body.\n\nIt must have been true, for the Bear snuffed at the Man\'s head awhile, and then, seeming to be satisfied that he was dead, walked away.\n\nThe Man in the tree climbed down.\n\n\"It looked just as if that Bear whispered in your ear,\" he said. \"What did he tell you?\"\n\n\"He said,\" answered the other, \"that it was not at all wise to keep company with a fellow who would desert his friend in a moment of danger.\"\n\nMoral: Misfortune is the test of true friendship.</string>
    <string name="story135text">A Porcupine was looking for a good home. At last he found a little sheltered cave, where lived a family of Snakes. He asked them to let him share the cave with them, and the Snakes kindly consented.\n\nThe Snakes soon wished they had not given him permission to stay. His sharp quills pricked them at every turn, and at last they politely asked him to leave.\n\n\"I am very well satisfied, thank you,\" said the Porcupine. \"I intend to stay right here.\" And with that, he politely escorted the Snakes out of doors. And to save their skins, the Snakes had to look for another home.\n\nMoral: Give a finger and lose a hand.</string>
    <string name="story136text">At a great meeting of the Animals, who had gathered to elect a new ruler, the Monkey was asked to dance. This he did so well, with a thousand funny capers and grimaces, that the Animals were carried entirely off their feet with enthusiasm, and then and there, elected him their king.\n\nThe Fox did not vote for the Monkey and was much disgusted with the Animals for electing so unworthy a ruler.\n\nOne day he found a trap with a bit of meat in it. Hurrying to King Monkey, he told him he had found a rich treasure, which he had not touched because it belonged by right to his majesty the Monkey.\n\nThe greedy Monkey followed the Fox to the trap. As soon as he saw the meat he grasped eagerly for it, only to find himself held fast in the trap. The Fox stood off and laughed.\n\n\"You pretend to be our king,\" he said, \"and cannot even take care of yourself!\"\n\nShortly after that, another election among the Animals was held.\n\nMoral: The true leader proves himself by his qualities.</string>
    <string name="story137text">A jar of honey was upset and the sticky sweetness flowed out on the table. The sweet smell of the honey soon brought a large number of Flies buzzing around. They did not wait for an invitation. No, indeed; they settled right down, feet and all, to gorge themselves. The Flies were quickly smeared from head to foot with honey. Their wings stuck together. They could not pull their feet out of the sticky mass. And so they died, giving their lives for the sake of a taste of sweetness.\n\nMoral: Be not greedy for a little passing pleasure.

    <string name="story139text">One day a Stag came to a Sheep and asked her to lend him a measure of wheat. The Sheep knew him for a very swift runner, who could easily take himself out of reach, were he so inclined. So she asked him if he knew someone who would answer for him.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" answered the Stag confidently, \"the Wolf has promised to be my surety.\"\n\n\"The Wolf!\" exclaimed the Sheep indignantly. \"Do you think I would trust you on such security?

    <string name="story140text">Once upon a time a severe plague raged among the animals. Many died, and those who lived were so ill, that they cared for neither food nor drink, and dragged themselves about listlessly. No longer could a fat young hen tempt Master Fox to dinner, nor a tender lamb rouse greedy Sir Wolf\'s appetite.\n\nAt last the Lion decided to call a council. When all the animals were gathered together he arose and said:\n\n\"Dear friends, I believe the gods have sent this plague upon us as a punishment for our sins. Therefore, the most guilty one of us must be offered in sacrifice. Perhaps we may thus obtain forgiveness and cure for all.\n\n\"I will confess all my sins first. I admit that I have been very greedy and have devoured many sheep. They had done me no harm. I have eaten goats and bulls and stags. To tell the truth, I even ate up a shepherd now and then.\n\n\"Now, if I am the most guilty, I am ready to be sacrificed. But I think it best that each one confess his sins as I have done. Then we can decide in all justice who is the most guilty.\"\n\n\"Your majesty,\" said the Fox, \"you are too good. Can it be a crime to eat sheep, such stupid mutton heads? No, no, your majesty. You have done them great honor by eating them up.\n\n\"And so far as shepherds are concerned, we all know they belong to that puny race that pretends to be our masters.\"\n\nAll the animals applauded the Fox loudly. Then, though the Tiger, the Bear, the Wolf, and all the savage beasts recited the most wicked deeds, all were excused and made to appear very saint-like and innocent.\n\nIt was now the Ass\'s turn to confess.\n\n\"I remember,\" he said guiltily, \"that one day as I was passing a field belonging to some priests, I was so tempted by the tender grass and my hunger, that I could not resist nibbling a bit of it. I had no right to do it, I admit—\"\n\nA great uproar among the beasts interrupted him. Here was the culprit who had brought misfortune on all of them! What a horrible crime it was to eat grass that belonged to someone else! It was enough to hang anyone for, much more an Ass.\n\nImmediately they all fell upon him, the Wolf in the lead, and soon had made an end to him, sacrificing him to the gods then and there, and without the formality of an altar.\n\nMoral: The weak are made to suffer for the misdeeds of the powerful.</string>
    <string name="story141text">A Shepherd, counting his Sheep one day, discovered that a number of them were missing.\n\nMuch irritated, he very loudly and boastfully declared that he would catch the thief and punish him as he deserved. The Shepherd suspected a Wolf of the deed and so set out toward a rocky region among the hills, where there were caves infested by Wolves. But before starting out he made a vow to Jupiter that if he would help him find the thief he would offer a fat Calf as a sacrifice.\n\nThe Shepherd searched a long time without finding any Wolves, but just as he was passing near a large cave on the mountain side, a huge Lion stalked out, carrying a Sheep. In great terror the Shepherd fell on his knees.\n\n\"Alas, O Jupiter, man does not know what he asks! To find the thief I offered to sacrifice a fat Calf. Now I promise you a full-grown Bull, if you but make the thief go away!\"\n\nMoral: We are often not so eager for what we seek, after we have found it.\nDo not foolishly ask for things that would bring ruin if they were granted.</string>
    <string name="story142text">A store of honey had been found in a hollow tree, and the Wasps declared positively that it belonged to them. The Bees were just as sure that the treasure was theirs. The argument grew very pointed, and it looked as if the affair could not be settled without a battle, when at last, with much good sense, they agreed to let a judge decide the matter. So they brought the case before the Hornet, justice of the peace in that part of the woods.\n\nWhen the Judge called the case, witnesses declared that they had seen certain winged creatures in the neighborhood of the hollow tree, who hummed loudly, and whose bodies were striped, yellow and black, like Bees.\n\nCounsel for the Wasps immediately insisted that this description fitted his clients exactly.\n\nSuch evidence did not help Judge Hornet to any decision, so he adjourned court for six weeks to give him time to think it over. When the case came up again, both sides had a large number of witnesses. An Ant was first to take the stand, and was about to be cross-examined, when a wise old Bee addressed the Court.\n\n\"Your honor,\" he said, \"the case has now been pending for six weeks. If it is not decided soon, the honey will not be fit for anything. I move that the Bees and the Wasps be both instructed to build a honey comb. Then we shall soon see to whom the honey really belongs.\"\n\nThe Wasps protested loudly. Wise Judge Hornet quickly understood why they did so: They knew they could not build a honey comb and fill it with honey.\n\n\"It is clear,\" said the Judge, \"who made the comb and who could not have made it. The honey belongs to the Bees.\"\n\nMoral: Ability proves itself by deeds.</string>
    <string name="story143text">A Lark made her nest in a field of young wheat. As the days passed, the wheat stalks grew tall and the young birds, too, grew in strength. Then one day, when the ripe golden grain waved in the breeze, the Farmer and his son came into the field.\n\n\"This wheat is now ready for reaping,\" said the Farmer. \"We must call in our neighbors and friends to help us harvest it.\"\n\nThe young Larks in their nest close by were much frightened, for they knew they would be in great danger if they did not leave the nest before the reapers came. When the Mother Lark returned with food for them, they told her what they had heard.\n\n\"Do not be frightened, children,\" said the Mother Lark. \"If the Farmer said he would call in his neighbors and friends to help him do his work, this -wheat will not be reaped for a while yet.\"\n\nA few days later, the wheat was so ripe, that when the wind shook the stalks, a hail of wheat grains came rustling down on the young Larks\' heads.\n\n\"If this wheat is not harvested at once,\" said the Farmer, \"we shall lose half the crop. We cannot wait any longer for help from our friends. Tomorrow we must set to work, ourselves.\"\n\nWhen the young Larks told their mother what they had heard that day, she said:\n\n\"Then we must be off at once. When a man decides to do his own work and not depend on any one else, then you may be sure there will be no more delay.\"\n\nThere was much fluttering and trying out of wings that afternoon, and at sunrise next day, when the Farmer and his son cut down the grain, they found an empty nest.\n\nMoral: Self-help is the best help.</string>
    <string name="story144text">There was once a Cat who was so watchful, that a Mouse hardly dared show the tip of his whiskers for fear of being eaten alive. That Cat seemed to be everywhere at once with his claws all ready for a pounce. At last the Mice kept so closely to their dens, that the Cat saw he would have to use his wits well to catch one. So one day he climbed up on a shelf and hung from it, head downward, as if he were dead, holding himself up by clinging to some ropes with one paw.\n\nWhen the Mice peeped out and saw him in that position, they thought he had been hung up there in punishment for some misdeed. Very timidly at first they stuck out their heads and sniffed about carefully. But as nothing stirred, all trooped joyfully out to celebrate the death of the Cat.\n\nJust then the Cat let go his hold, and before the Mice recovered from their surprise, he had made an end of three or four.\n\nNow the Mice kept more strictly at home than ever. But the Cat, who was still hungry for Mice, knew more tricks than one. Rolling himself in flour until he was covered completely, he lay down in the flour bin, with one eye open for the Mice.\n\nSure enough, the Mice soon began to come out. To the Cat it was almost as if he already had a plump young Mouse under his claws, when an old Rat, who had had much experience with Cats and traps, and had even lost a part of his tail to pay for it, sat up at a safe distance from a hole in the wall where he lived.\n\n\"Take care!\" he cried. \"That may be a heap of meal, but it looks to me very much like the Cat. Whatever it is, it is wisest to keep at a safe distance.\"\n\nMoral: The wise do not let themselves be tricked a second time.</string>
    <string name="story145text">A Traveler had hired an Ass to carry him to a distant part of the country. The owner of the Ass went with the Traveler, walking beside him to drive the Ass and point out the way.\n\nThe road led across a treeless plain where the Sun beat down fiercely. So intense did the heat become, that the Traveler at last decided to stop for a rest, and as there was no other shade to be found, the Traveler sat down in the shadow of the Ass.\n\nNow the heat had affected the Driver as much as it had the Traveler, and even more, for he had been walking. Wishing also to rest in the shade cast by the Ass, he began to quarrel with the Traveler, saying he had hired the Ass and not the shadow it cast.\n\nThe two soon came to blows, and while they were fighting, the Ass took to its heels.\n\nMoral: In quarreling about the shadow we often lose the substance.</string>
    <string name="story146text">One day, a long time ago, an old Miller and his Son were on their way to market with an Ass which they hoped to sell. They drove him very slowly, for they thought they would have a better chance to sell him if they kept him in good condition. As they walked along the highway some travelers laughed loudly at them.\n\n\"What foolishness,\" cried one, \"to walk when they might as well ride. The most stupid of the three is not the one you would expect it to be.\"\n\nThe Miller did not like to be laughed at, so he told his son to climb up and ride.\n\nThey had gone a little farther along the road, when three merchants passed by.\n\n\"Oho, what have we here?\" they cried. \"Respect old age, young man! Get down, and let the old man ride.\"\n\nThough the Miller was not tired, he made the boy get down and climbed up himself to ride, just to please the Merchants.\n\nAt the next turnstile they overtook some women carrying market baskets loaded with vegetables and other things to sell.\n\n\"Look at the old fool,\" exclaimed one of them. \"Perched on the Ass, while that poor boy has to walk.\"\n\nThe Miller felt a bit vexed, but to be agreeable he told the Boy to climb up behind him.\n\nThey had no sooner started out again than a loud shout went up from another company of people on the road.\n\n\"What a crime,\" cried one, \"to load up a poor dumb beast like that! They look more able to carry the poor creature, than he to carry them.\"\n\n\"They must be on their way to sell the poor thing\'s hide,\" said another.\n\nThe Miller and his Son quickly scrambled down, and a short time later, the market place was thrown into an uproar as the two came along carrying the Donkey slung from a pole. A great crowd of people ran out to get a closer look at the strange sight.\n\nThe Ass did not dislike being carried, but so many people came up to point at him and laugh and shout, that he began to kick and bray, and then, just as they were crossing a bridge, the ropes that held him gave way, and down he tumbled into the river.\n\nThe poor Miller now set out sadly for home. By trying to please everybody, he had pleased nobody, and lost his Ass besides.\n\nMoral: If you try to please all, you please none.</string>
    <string name="story147text">Mother Goat was going to market one morning to get provisions for her household, which consisted of but one little Kid and herself.\n\n\"Take good care of the house, my son,\" she said to the Kid, as she carefully latched the door. \"Do not let anyone in, unless he gives you this password: \'Down with the Wolf and all his race!\'\"\n\nStrangely enough, a Wolf was lurking near and heard what the Goat had said. So, as soon as Mother Goat was out of sight, up he trotted to the door and knocked.\n\n\"Down with the Wolf and all his race,\" said the Wolf softly.\n\nIt was the right password, but when the Kid peeped through a crack in the door and saw the shadowy figure outside, he did not feel at all easy.\n\n\"Show me a white paw,\" he said, \"or I won\'t let you in.\"\n\nA white paw, of course, is a feature few Wolves can show, and so Master Wolf had to go away as hungry as he had come.\n\n\"You can never be too sure,\" said the Kid, when he saw the Wolf making off to the woods.\n\nMoral: Two sureties are better than one.</string>
    <string name="story148text">The Swallow and the Crow had an argument one day about their plumage.\n\nSaid the Swallow: \"Just look at my bright and downy feathers. Your black stiff quills are not worth having. Why don\'t you dress better? Show a little pride!\"\n\n\"Your feathers may do very well in spring,\" replied the Crow, \"but—I don\'t remember ever having seen you around in winter, and that\'s when I enjoy myself most.\"\n\nMoral: Friends in fine weather only, are not worth much.</string>
    <string name="story149text">There was once a baby show among the Animals in the forest. Jupiter provided the prize. Of course all the proud mammas from far and near brought their babies. But none got there earlier than Mother Monkey. Proudly she presented her baby among the other contestants.\n\nAs you can imagine, there was quite a laugh when the Animals saw the ugly flat-nosed, hairless, pop-eyed little creature.\n\n\"Laugh if you will,\" said the Mother Monkey. \"Though Jupiter may not give him the prize, I know that he is the prettiest, the sweetest, the dearest darling in the world.\"\n\nMoral: Mother love is blind.</string>
    <string name="story150text">A Lion, an Ass, and a Fox were hunting in company, and caught a large quantity of game. The Ass was asked to divide the spoil. This he did very fairly, giving each an equal share.\n\nThe Fox was well satisfied, but the Lion flew into a great rage over it, and with one stroke of his huge paw, he added the Ass to the pile of slain.\n\nThen he turned to the Fox.\n\n\"You divide it,\" he roared angrily.\n\nThe Fox wasted no time in talking. He quickly piled all the game into one great heap. From this he took a very small portion for himself, such undesirable bits as the horns and hoofs of a mountain goat, and the end of an ox tail.\n\nThe Lion now recovered his good humor entirely.\n\n\"Who taught you to divide so fairly?\" he asked pleasantly.\n\n\"I learned a lesson from the Ass,\" replied the Fox, carefully edging away.\n\nMoral: Learn from the misfortunes of others.</string>
    <string name="story151text">A long time ago, the Lion, the Fox, the Jackal, and the Wolf agreed to go hunting together, sharing with each other whatever they found.\n\nOne day the Wolf ran down a Stag and immediately called his comrades to divide the spoil.\n\nWithout being asked, the Lion placed himself at the head of the feast to do the carving, and, with a great show of fairness, began to count the guests.\n\n\"One,\" he said, counting on his claws, \"that is myself the Lion. Two, that\'s the Wolf, three, is the Jackal, and the Fox makes four.\"\n\nHe then very carefully divided the Stag into four equal parts.\n\n\"I am King Lion,\" he said, when he had finished, \"so of course I get the first part. This next part falls to me because I am the strongest; and this is mine because I am the bravest.\"\n\nHe now began to glare at the others very savagely. \"If any of you have any claim to the part that is left,\" he growled, stretching his claws meaningly, \"now is the time to speak up.\"\n\nMoral: Might makes right.</string>
    <string name="story152text">A little Mole once said to his Mother:\n\n\"Why, Mother, you said I was blind! But I am sure I can see!\"\n\nMother Mole saw she would have to get such conceit out of his head. So she put a bit of frankincense before him and asked him to tell what it was.\n\nThe little Mole peered at it.\n\n\"Why, that\'s a pebble!\"\n\n\"Well, my son, that proves you\'ve lost your sense of smell as well as being blind.\"\n\nMoral: Boast of one thing and you will be found lacking in that and a few other things as well.</string>
    <string name="story153text">The North Wind and the Sun had a quarrel about which of them was the stronger. While they were disputing with much heat and bluster, a Traveler passed along the road wrapped in a cloak.\n\n\"Let us agree,\" said the Sun, \"that he is the stronger who can strip that Traveler of his cloak.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" growled the North Wind, and at once sent a cold, howling blast against the Traveler.\n\nWith the first gust of wind the ends of the cloak whipped about the Traveler\'s body. But he immediately wrapped it closely around him, and the harder the Wind blew, the tighter he held it to him. The North Wind tore angrily at the cloak, but all his efforts were in vain.\n\nThen the Sun began to shine. At first his beams were gentle, and in the pleasant warmth after the bitter cold of the North Wind, the Traveler unfastened his cloak and let it hang loosely from his shoulders. The Sun\'s rays grew warmer and warmer. The man took off his cap and mopped his brow. At last he became so heated that he pulled off his cloak, and, to escape the blazing sunshine, threw himself down in the welcome shade of a tree by the roadside.\n\nMoral: Gentleness and kind persuasion win where force and bluster fail.</string>
    <string name="story154text">A pack of Wolves lurked near the Sheep pasture. But the Dogs kept them all at a respectful distance, and the Sheep grazed in perfect safety. But now the Wolves thought of a plan to trick the Sheep.\n\n\"Why is there always this hostility between us?\" they said. \"If it were not for those Dogs who are always stirring up trouble, I am sure we should get along beautifully. Send them away and you will see what good friends we shall become.\"\n\nThe Sheep were easily fooled. They persuaded the Dogs to go away, and that very evening the Wolves had the grandest feast of their lives.\n\nMoral: Do not give up friends for foes.</string>
    <string name="story155text">A Fox was caught in a trap one fine morning, because he had got too near the Farmer\'s hen house. No doubt he was hungry, but that was not an excuse for stealing. A Cock, rising early, discovered what had happened. He knew the Fox could not get at him, so he went a little closer to get a good look at his enemy.\n\nThe Fox saw a slender chance of escape.\n\n\"Dear friend,\" he said, \"I was just on my way to visit a sick relative, when I stumbled into this string and got all tangled up. But please do not tell anybody about it. I dislike causing sorrow to anybody, and I am sure I can soon gnaw this string to pieces.\"\n\nBut the Cock was not to be so easily fooled. He soon roused the whole hen yard, and when the Farmer came running out, that was the end of Mr. Fox.\n\nMoral: The wicked deserve no aid.</string>
    <string name="story156text">An Ass found a Lion\'s skin left in the forest by a hunter. He dressed himself in it, and amused himself by hiding in a thicket and rushing out suddenly at the animals who passed that way. All took to their heels the moment they saw him.\n\nThe Ass was so pleased to see the animals running away from him, just as if he were King Lion himself, that he could not keep from expressing his delight by a loud, harsh bray. A Fox, who ran with the rest, stopped short as soon as he heard the voice. Approaching the Ass, he said with a laugh:\n\n\"If you had kept your mouth shut you might have frightened me, too. But you gave yourself away with that silly bray.\"\n\nMoral: A fool may deceive by his dress and appearance, but his words will soon show what he really is.</string>
    <string name="story157text">Once there were two Cocks living in the same farmyard who could not bear the sight of each other. At last one day they flew up to fight it out, beak and claw. They fought until one of them was beaten and crawled off to a corner to hide.\n\nThe Cock that had won the battle flew to the top of the hen-house, and, proudly flapping his wings, crowed with all his might to tell the world about his victory. But an Eagle, circling overhead, heard the boasting chanticleer and, swooping down, carried him off to his nest.\n\nHis rival saw the deed, and coming out of his corner, took his place as master of the farmyard.\n\nMoral: Pride goes before a fall.</string>
